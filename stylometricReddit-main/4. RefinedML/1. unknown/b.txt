if the cheating happened during a marriage i would say take some time for yourself dont be in any rush to get into another relationship treat it like a death you need time to grieve the loss and when you feel ready then you can get back out there 

if you were just dating this shouldnt be causing you so much angst that youd be averse to ever dating again 
this was one scummy person out of thousands you will meet in your life time 

millions of people cheat and as many get cheated on it happens we deal with it and get on with living its not the end of the world
why are you letting him insult you 
this is a person who loves you id hate to see him when he doesnt like you  

i suspect he wants you to do better so you will have more money to bail him out with 

you know this but you are doing just fine you can pay your bills support your kid and really can buy whatever you want if not right this minute but with some planning 

stop giving him money and do not move in with him ever you will be stuck paying for it by yourself
after 7 years youre finally getting tired of this

i wouldnt have lasted 7 days 

be honest with yourself here he absolutely is not going to wake up one day and be secure enough that he will stop this behavior 

so you either put up with it or you break up hes way too insecure to have any middle ground
first off dont change anything fundamentally you for anyone 

second you said youre studying for med school so use all this extra free time to do just that but get out at least for a bit every day take a walk study in a park coffee shop anywhere else than where you live 

third youre young but not a child you started dating as a kid tho idk what you did that he thinks you hurt him so bad that he doesnt want to date anymore but it does not matter this breakup is not totally your fault so stop thinking that way there will be others you will date and break up with use this as a lesson to not lose yourself to a partner 

fourth get back in touch with the friends that you let fall to the side if you did indeed lose them from studying too much they should understand 

fifth stop studying so much 
there is a point where it doesnt actually help studying is for review not for learning the material 

this all will pass and be a distant memory you will look back on and wonder why you ever wanted him so badly to begin with
yup me too 
they wanted to make it look like she was 
and harry lobbied for her but the palace said no way
then your wife had all the time in the world to pick him up from school and she should have 
plus your d was away and its a perfect time for some mom son bonding time 

your son is 13 hes going into some crazy years your wife should take those rides to and from school as an opportunity to just talk to ty about whats going on in his life and if that includes james even better 
they do say car rides are the best way to get kids to open up
i think theres no reason you should have known who was picking up ty since im guessing your wife stays home with the kids and usually does the school runs 

but if your wife is home why is your 4 yo at grandmas for the last month 

since you had discussed not letting him have too much contact with your son i think it was short sighted of your wife to allow him to pick the kids up for weeks  weeks 

i think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell ty together  honestly i think a good talk about what he says and where its said should be enough what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff but whatever 

but i also think you and wife should discuss that shes going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens and im not talking punishments im talking correcting bad behavior when its not even so bad so that it doesnt get bad 
this isnt 1950 where its wait until your father gets home
because people now feel like every day has to be a good one a magical day where their partner makes them feel special at all times 

their lives have to be picture perfect their partner the perfect one the proposal and marriage have to be planned down to the last detail and one little bump just ruins the whole thing its all so superficial 

that is not reality a lot of long relationships are quite mundane but nobody wants to stay thru that to get to the next special moment but the mundane makes the special that much more 

add to that the sense of entitlement it seems people have everyone cannot have the dream job and make a million dollars so they can buy the biggest house and the most expensive car 

so people basically are unsatisfied with their own lives so they feel they have to jump from one person to the next looking for someone else to make their life satisfying 

married 30 years since our 20s and it just works because we are ok with the highs and lows we just take what comes and deal with it
you sit back and take stock of whats going on in your own life 

then you decide am i going to let my life be dictated by others or am i going to take matters in my own hands 

leave the emotion out of it no issue is ever solved by the heart you need to use your head 

in this instance you get mad 
id be thinking
who the heck does this person think they are to treat me badly when ive done nothing to deserve it 
hes obviously up to no good im not gonna sit here and take it  im out he can do whatever he wants but im not sticking around and watching 

and then you say that loud and firm this isnt a discussion its a decision 
its your decision
ok so you know exactly what kind of person he is 

do you think you deserve to be talked to in this way
do you think a partner has the right to demean you to get what he wants 

why are you still entertaining being involved with him 

this is a person who has denied your existence to his family based on his religion im gonna guess and say his religion probably would frown upon him asking for nudes to get off to
that in itself is so disgustingly gross to me that id cut contact with him he sees you as less than and you have allowed yourself to believe it 

tell him to take a hike find a real man who will treat you with dignity and respect
have you ever met this guy 
and by that i mean have you ever lived in the same place and actually dated and are long distance due to one of you needing to move
you find std meds and you didnt ask what he was taking it for 
did he willingly tell you he was going for an std test  and you didnt ask him why he felt the need to 
and hes checking himself all night and again you didnt ask what he was looking for 

do you two even talk to each other 

yeah you know whats going on you guys have been together since youre teens its run its course
ill be honest i would not continue dating him drugs are a hard no for me 

you say youre ok with coke at a party but really its never going to stay at just parties and hes already tried heroin after 2 months 

im more curious tho about how he just picked up this little habit did he just wake up one day and say hey think ill use coke today and see how it goes 

if hes addicted its really really hard to break the addiction he will relapse 
he will lie 
are you prepared for this major upheaval in your life the highs when hes clean and the very low lows when he relapses the in and out of rehab 

id tell him he has to do this on his own for himself when hes clean and has his life all back together then to give you a call and you can see what 
you want to do 

good luck its hard to see someone you love struggle but its his struggle dont make it yours
so the story i just read his lawyer argued he was mentally ill 
no mention of being autistic so that had no bearing on why he killed 

sorry i agree with the judge he should never see another day free 

he was 20 so even though technically a minor whatever law you mentioned shouldnt apply to him as he must have been tried as an adult
whats to question 
youre a boy you are were attracted to this person who presents as a girl therefore you are straight 

now this person says theyre a boy but they still look like a girl so youre still attracted and still straight 

does this persons family know they think theyre a boy
did you ask them if they think theyre a boy are they gay then since they presumably like you and youre also a boy 

still not going anywhere romantically just be friends
ok i have to ask

are you straight and thought you were dating a girl 

or are you gay and thought you were dating a guy  

if youre straight then obviously you cannot date this person because they think they are a boy and you are not into boys 

if youre gay then you can date this person because they think theyre a boy  except for the fact that they look like a girl and you arent attracted to girls 

this is going nowhere romantically 

just be friends since you seem to get along so well then it wont matter if theyre a boy or girl
how old are you two 
how is it that your salary is all of a sudden not enough 

what did the two of you change
has rose explained why she never told you about being pregnant otherwise its going to be a very awkward dinner 

but i think youre trying to do the right thing its up to rose to realize its what her d wants
sorry but she knows the real reason she doesnt want to have sex and its not stress or low self esteem 

she would have had to been super stressed every day for the past 5 years  and really a lot of people will use sex to combat stress 

if she still has self esteem issues after being in a loving committed relationship for 5 years then shes got  therapist level issues that she needs to address 

you two need to have an honest to a fault discussion about this 

ill bet shes probably more asexual than she will ever admit to you because shed be afraid of losing you 
but you cannot sustain a relationship without honesty especially on this subject
maybe just stop lying 
have a sit down and explain you are so close to being an adult and you have to start making choices for yourself 
if they turn out to be bad so be it but at least you did it and learned from it 

and idk how your schools work but if you dont know history or geography how are you going to be allowed to actually graduate there has to be some minimum grade you have to get and if there is and youre making it just tell him that too
your bmr might be off if youre using the same number from when you were 250 lbs 

recalculate it
you do realize that your sole job is not to make him happy 
of course in a relationship each person makes the other happy but not from doing every whim the other has 

also you are your bfs first gf from what you wrote he didnt seem to have friends either and didnt leave the house much 

he didnt have the usual date around as a teen figure out all the dating rituals etc 
idk how you two met or why he was finally able to connect with you and have a relationship 
that might not bide well for the two of you as he may feel like he missed out on dating around and sleeping around plus most first relationships do not work out long term  but those are usually had as a teen which he didnt
his idea of having threesomes may be his attempt to experience others without losing you hell get to sleep with others 
and having 2 permanent gfs might be way of dating around hell have to navigate more than just one personality 

im probably reading too much into it  but thats the first thought that came to mind
i agree its sad almost 
i buzz my ha hair and i told him when he has nothing but a horseshoe we have to think about shaving it 

but i would not just not say anything 

but who knows maybe hs happy with it 
while i absolutely agree it is monumentally stupid for a 17 yo to have a car loan i suspect there was a lot more going on 

op says son wanted to live with mom almost full time so i suspect dad gave in to the car if not more just to keep son happy and not hate him 

and lets not forget mom probably had a hand in that decision also its not just dad
he put money away for college and cars its not that the money he gave them to invest was going to be the only money they had for college 

some kids are spenders and some are savers and no matter how much talking showing and giving advice they will not change until they are faces with the consequences 

son can still go to college he just doesnt have the option of any college he got admitted to his list shrinks due to money issues 

remember too that d is making up the diff between what the parents saved for them which would be what they are willing to pay or can afford and the actual cost out of her savings
yta massive 

come on dad as much as you are scared about what is happening with your wife double that for your son 

he is losing his mother  the one person who has always always been there for him 

so instead of coming together and trying to hold both of you up you get mad because he didnt clean his room 
really how important is his room right this minute 
give him a break 

and im sorry but i dont understand the significance of the hair if someone could explain please
the minute he told you to delete a friend for any reason is the exact minute you should have broken up with him 

when are young people going to understand this  its irrational its jealousy and its controlling
i say let bf pick whoever he wants as best man 

maybe ask your bf why if sb is such a bad person it would mean so much to him to be there 

is there more to the relationship between sb and bf that means so much to bf was sb good to him at a time in bfs life when he needed someone was sb a mentor for bf something anything 
then i would take that into consideration also 

it just seems odd that sb is pretty much hated by everyone but your bf isnt really seeing that and i wonder why
bring back the hat and rename back to hollywood studios 
we still call it that anyway 

weve been going since 94 and dont even remember that hand sign i had to look it up to see what it looked like i dont like it
then youre going to have to remind her of the agreement to not be in the room while you work 

maybe include in that convo that her anxiety seems to be getting bad again and she should start getting a handle on it now before it gets bad enough that her school and work will suffer maybe suggest she start looking for a new job now if she loses her job or quits will you be able to afford it  dont wait until shes crippled with her anxiety to decide to address it
at this point just swap rooms with her she can set up her school stuff in the br 

this way if she wants to stay in bed all day she can and if she wants to do her schoolwork she can also 

it seems like shes going to either quit her job or get fired so you might as well give her the bedroom now so when shes home all day you wont be dealing with this every day
her motivation is to just hang on to you long enough for you to marry her 
then shes all set 

honestly i would be embarrassed if my date showed up to a family thing so woefully underdressed but only if i have already explained what the vibe of these parties are did you explain this to her if you did and she still made no effort that would be a big problem
you didnt pressure him into not telling his family but you also only told him when you were 5 months along 

im sure he knew how could he not but it seems odd that you seemingly confirmed the pregnancy and was im guessing all excited but you didnt share it with him did you share this news with anyone 
he didnt get to have that surprise reveal from you and share the excitement 

im curious tho what family traditions of his does he not agree with
my dermo told me to just moisturize them like thats gonna help 

i remember as a kid there used to be a commercial for age spots i think it fades them  

im thinking of looking for something like that but i cannot remember that exact name tho
i had to go back to make sure but 

you are 16  you have years and years and years ahead of you to find that special person 

are you expecting to meet someone now that you will stay with forever  its not going to happen teen romances very rarely last 

your teen years are for figuring out all this dating stuff so ask out any girl who seems to be nice cute or have a same interest as you 

and stop worrying so much desperation is not attractive at all
you dont think youre attracted to her so give it one more date 

dont discount that you two could just be friends if you enjoy her company
heres how i look at it as long as my partner is just looking and not engaging with any of these people especially if they dont even live anywhere near us i dont have a problem with it 

there are so many other people who could tempt my partner right where we live that i really am not going to be jealous or worry about a picture on a screen 

its basically harmless 
but thats just my personal feeling
pretty sure anyone who reads a newspaper or had any form of sm knows about it and talked about it 

we heard all about it talked about it speculated about it waited for all the details to finally come out and 

we got a list of people who flew in a plane 
virginia guiffree got her payday andrew is relegated to scum of the world je is dead and ghislaine is in jail 

what more is there to say 
no one who was kidnapped or trafficked has come out in public and accused anyone else  im not even sure they named anyone in any kind of sealed legal documents
sometimes relationships just run its course she was 17 when you started andnow shes an adult 
she wants to do all those things that she missed out on that all her friends got to do while she just sat on the sideline and watched 

i think its absolutely gross that she called you and basically told you she cheated on you and was planning on taking this random home that alone would make me lose any feelings for this person 

so dont concentrate on what you lost concentrate on the fact that she didnt even have enough respect for you to have a conversation about the fact that she was doubting this relationship and needing some time to decide if she still wants it 

she doesnt want you shell go play around for a while and is expecting you to be there when the grass isnt greener dont be that guy block her on everything youre worth more than that
wait 
the dad didnt want one 

what did the wife want 

cause the fact that her best friend wanted one and they had it is extremely bizarre to me
maybe its a good idea that his overbearing parents step in and actually get all of them on the right path 

even if hes depressed he seems to be able to do the farm work he just starts much later than most farmers 

but if he got to sleep at a decent time he should be able to get started after he puts the kids on the bus 

talk to him and his parents 
im sure the parents know this whole situation has to change and if theyre so overbearing i cant really see how they let it get so out of hand 

i dont think youre too involved you care about his family and only want whats best doe them
i think youre trying to get him to be more responsible about his farm and getting the work done no 

if thats the case just waking him up isnt really going to help unless he stays up and does the work who is working his farm 

i think you need to have a serious talk with him 
if you guys were so close what happened when did fam dinners stop when did you stop working for him 
you said the behavior changed a year ago so what was it like prior to that 

and where are the kids mother does she not see them at all does she also just let them do whatever  


he needs to get his kids on a better schedule his 4 yo should not be up till all hours of the night what is he thinking by allowing this and his other 2 need more sleep than they are getting 

talk to him explain your concerns if you are as close as you say he might open up and explain whats going on with him 

is it possible for you to talk with his parents about the kids schedule or the state of the farm  do his parents not see what is going on
why do you want to get past this

hes been doing this stuff for 6 years what makes you think hes going to stop
see heres the thing as i see it

yes she cheated and that in itself would be a reason to stay separated and ultimately divorce 

but you have to also realize that you werent a model partner to her either  you lost your job over drinking and im gonna assume when you drank you werent exactly a great husband to her 

now i am absolutely not saying you drove her to cheat or am i excusing her cheating 

im saying that you two should both just cut your losses and split up at this point there are just too many issues that neither of you will ever be able to forgive forget or get over 

get some help for the drinking its no way to live and her affair partner can worry if shell cheat on him thats not your problem any more
thank you 
now i understand what ppl mean when they say it
can i ask what they nickel and dime you for
i hear the words im reading in my head but i actually read too fast and find i dont retain what i read sometimes 

so i have to purposely make myself read slower and if i dont understand what i read i read it very slowly out loud pausing to make sure im getting it 

im curious tho have you tried to purposely read faster what happens do you retain the info
i love that you know that much history of your family 
have you been back to hungary to meet your relatives still in the village there  

those pics are so classic 50s america
i dont necessarily have a problem with these materials being shipped they have to be shipped somehow but id like the rail companies to have an emergency response team that is always ready to jump right in if something were to happen 

an approved maybe regulated plan from outside the company preferably
good job on the script that way nothing gets taken out of context and you say all that needs to be said 

and i never meant to imply anything dangerous or reckless about the weed as far as the baby goes just saying its not the best in the long run for his problem
ah big ones 
i searched quick but didnt find anything helpful 

so id say go to the er but id tell them they passed out the same day that way its an emergency and they have to treat 

im sorry i hope your relative will be ok
while i agree you cannot make him go and get help i would have one more conversation about it 

frame it as this we have a child we need to make sure we are at our best for them if you wont get help for yourself at least do it for our child its not healthy that your child will grow up seeing dad have a panic attack every day and its not healthy to self medicate with marijuana ive got nothing against it it just ultimately isnt going to solve his problem its just pushing it down the road 

tell him youll go with him to any and all appointments until he finds a dr or therapist he likes  id ask friends neighborsanyone for a recommendation and id call and explain his apprehension and ask them to please use kid gloves with him
what kind of work up did the dr recommend 
i dont know about the er but id be surprised if they would do a work up there im assuming a work up would be like a check up with labs 

i found this tho



specifically look at the medical walk in and wellness in metuchen 
it seems they are free and will do a check up which usually involves lab work idk how the lab work would be billed tho maybe give them a call and ask explain what happened and what the dr said
we need to know why your son has seemingly cut contact with you until he needs you to sign over the car 

depending on why the no contact im not so sure id sign over the car since you had to pay off his sallie mae loan 
are you sure hes paying off his car you might get stuck with that too 

but i also agree i would never ever sign a blank document if youre going to sign it over id make sure to fill it out first you should know all then i do its asking for and take and keep a copy of the filled out form
this is what i did and i am absolutely no expert by any stretch but this will at least help you to get an idea of how to get started 

go here 



this will give you an idea of how many calories you need to maintain your weight 
then subtract 25 of that amount and aim to eat that each day 

get a food scale to weigh everything 

then i just planned out what to eat for bl and dinner for the next 2 or 3 days i went shopping so i had everything i needed to stick with it 

i very rarely eat breakfast just coffee but i almost always had a huge salad for lunch with tomato olives carrot cucumber and a protein the protein was either left over chicken from the night before or even just a can of tuna  in water i did add dressing but a low cal and never more than 2 tbspns 
dinner was 3 or 4 oz of chicken fish or beef and vegetables and a small salad lots of vegs 
and water was the only thing i drank lots and lots of water 

snacks were portioned out nuts or a string cheese or just plain carrots 
have a glass of water before you snack to see if you really want to snack  or if you just wanted something 

it seems daunting at first but you will get used to it pretty quickly 

but weigh everything  i even weighed out teeny amounts of carrot and celery for my salad a lot of times it ended up being like 6 calories but i still counted it 

you can do this just dont try to be so militant crazy to start because you wont stick with it its ok to be over your calories when you start but you want to be over by 50 not 500
i would cruise alone but make sure to go to the solo traveler meet up on the ship

go meet other solos these would be the people you can hang around with on that sailing and you might get lucky and find one or two who you get along with and can plan future trips with 

i wouldnt trust rooming with a random stranger
im a little confused about justin 

hes not the babys dad we know that 
you met him when you both lived in diff states and somehow he just decided he would be dad and you allowed that 
then you break up and he still wants to be dad even going as far as wanting to help with daycare 
have you even met this person have you ever lived in the same place 
all of this seems really really odd 

you broke up he wasnt in your life or your sons for all that long as a dad figure so why would you even entertain the idea of him being a father figure to your son 

now brian on the other hand do you 
know for a fact that he is the father  

because honestly it might be better for your son if hes not  the in out is ultimately going to leave your child feeling not enough he doesnt support the child and you seem to be doing ok without him 

and now greg i would have him tested to see if hes actually your sons dad 
even if you dont want any support from him and even if he doesnt want anything to do with his child its better for everyone involved to have a definitive answer to this question 

if he is then you can cut brian out all together because really who needs the problems he comes with hes out of state has 2 other kids is in and out on a whim and doesnt pay any support 

in short
 find out who the father actually is then decide if you want to go for support and visitation 
 dont have some random out of town guy playing dad to your son
 live your life raise your son and dont be so quick to want to have a daddy for him
yta
show some respect for your grandfather and your grandmother 

is this really something you want to even have an argument with your family about at this time 
everyones stressed on edge and its going to become about more than what it actually is 

this is not the time or place for you to make this about you your clothing choices over the years or what your family thinks about your choices 

either wear the dress pants or bring them and change into them
why are you even entertaining anything she says 

after telling her youre done this is not working for you anymore wish her well and hang up  
block her everywhere and get on with your life 

she lives 4 hrs away from you its not like shes gonna go around town talking about you or making your life miserable 

its not really that hard
this has been my fear forever 

also not just being uncovered but i could never even have my feet hang off the bed 

i do not have any idea how people sleep with no covers not even a sheet nope i need an actual comforter even in the summer
nta at all 

this is a lovely thing to do with your nieces 
and especially since its the younger ones first time it should be just the 4 of you 

this is something you and your sister can do forever with the girls and they will love it 

im sure your sil does things with her sibs and all the kids they dont have to infringe on your day
ok so wait im confused 
the general tip box welfare thing what exactly is this 

are you saying the gratuities that we all pay is not going to the crew
ive read its room steward and the other positions that guests dont see like cooks laundry etc workers who dont normally interact with guests 

i always pay mine and give the steward extra but id like to know that the behind the scenes people are getting their cut 

so if we dont pay it the cook and laundry people will still get their same salary but the company will then be shouldering the burden of that whole amount  which they should anyway instead of being supplemented by guests 

if thats the case im taking my tips off and will try to find a way to funnel  to those people and of course tip the steward his cut plus my extra 

am i understanding this correctly
nah 
but he cannot always respond the way you want or need he doesnt know what you want him to do or what you need 

heres the thing tho 
youve been together since you were 15 and both of you are going to go off to college and will have a whole host of new experiences and meet new people not just him 

not to be mean but i would be very surprised if one of you if not both of you get to college and realize you dont want to be tied down to someone who is not part of your every day it could very well be you deciding theres someone else out there that youd like to get to know 

it happens and it should happen you both need to be free to grow and mature 

the summer before college is a weird time both of you are going to be anxious nervous about going away being on your own for the first time can you handle it will you find friends will you be able to keep up with classes etc 
so dont stress about hypothetical things when you have enough real things that will stress you out
we went twice in one day and my h was that guy both times 
the rest of us loved it he was not amused 
nta for not giving a gift 

its costing you a lot to go and she did say its understandable so believe her 

before i say more tho what kind of reception has no alcohol and no food what exactly is everyone supposed to do during the party part of the wedding reception 

but theres a few things you say that come off as concerning

why do you care that they are married but having the celebration later maybe they did it for tax purposes for religious reasons or just because they felt like it not your business 

your thought that she wont be giving you a gift when you get married next year is bizarre they are almost 10 yrs younger than you and your bf how much of a gift were you actually expecting from them

not having alcohol at the wedding isnt odd at all really plenty of people make that choice 

im getting weird vibes as if youre taking her wedding as a slight against you personally somehow 
shes having her celebration before yours even tho youve been engaged longer she picked the worst time according to your schedule and her wedding is not what you deem acceptable 
her wedding really has nothing to do with you your bf or anyone else 

you understandably said its costing you a lot to go and how its really stretching the budget but youve already got 2 weddings youre going to next year undoubtably your friends or fam and i can see how youd say well those were planned and hers was a quickie thing that came up and wasnt really budgeted for but this is the family you are going to marry into so id stretch that budget go with a smile and dont burn bridges before youve even been accepted into the family 

and its not your place to fight your bfs family battles if hes always put last its up to him to fix it or not im still not sure what the parents or grands having money has anything to do with bf being put last tho
i think it comes from our education system 
most people graduate hs at 1718 and years back it was pretty common to get married to your hs sweetheart 

so if youre married at 18 you have to be allowed to do all the adult things job mortgage kids etc 

and i agree with the other poster by 18 youve seen and heard enough to be able to make wise choices why some might not is for the same reasons why a 25 or 35 or any other age might not
im going to assume youre still somewhat young 

ignoring him isnt the way to go about this or any other issue or problem that comes up 

use your words you think he was joking but youre not sure so you ignore him for 15 min but then after that amount of time you what just start engaging with him again as if nothing happened 
then what was the actual point of not talking to him in the first place 

look if he says something and you arent sure if its an insult or a joke you have two ways to handle this

 might be a joke answer back with a joke  youre free to leave at any time theres the door and see what he says he probably would answer back with something like he just hates shopping thats like the hundredth store weve been in etc 
you banter back and forth a few times and its over 

 you think its insulting then you tell him  hey that hurt whats the problem and he explains the exact same thing as above hes just frustrated being in the mall 

learn now how to communicate it will save you tons of drama in the future
think back to every place you have been since you last remember seeing it on the counter 
like literally sit down close your eyes and go back thru every single thing youve done 

check every outfit you wore every car you were in every couch you sat on every backpack or pocketbook you used 
were you studying at any time check in your books 
did you pack a carry on or travel bag check the outside pockets
its only been 5 months why are you so desperate to keep this guy 

he treats you horribly and you keep going back for more 

block him everywhere stay single for a bit i think you need to feel better about yourself before you get involved with anyone

do a lot of research understand what you are getting for that price look at the ship and decide if it has the amenities you would like 

booking air thru the cruise line means you get the cheapest flight they can get times might not be ideal i suggest paying for a 1 or 2 day deviation so youre in the uk early in case of flight delays 

check out costco travel also 
if you have a cc with miles see if you can use them for flights and then you can shop around for travel agent deals also  but if you book thru a 3 rd party travel agent just know that the cruise line will not speak to you about anything to do with the booking because you technically are not the one who booked it 

i hope this helps
i agree so much with this 

i dont like mexican food all that much but i have never even tried refried beans 
just the look of it never mind the smell makes me gag

its pretty standard procedure which if hes a regular he would know 

anyway would it help if you mentioned it to the dr 
i would like to think the dr doesnt want him talking to his staff the way he did
you dont say how long you are together 

in my opinion this is in no way cheating 

what happened was you saw a very attractive person and had a physical response to the level of attractiveness 
it happens whatever this guy looked like just hit your senses in a certain way 

it doesnt mean you dont find your bf attractive doesnt mean you dont like or love him 

i wouldnt say a word to bf all that will do is start drama of you dont find me attractive you dont want to be with me you want him 
honestly its just not worth it 
are you bored that youre not fighting anymore cause this feels like youre looking for more things to fight about 

you guys are really young but if you are under the misguided idea that once you love someone you should never find any other person attractive youre going to find that is just not the case 
if you think your bf does not find any other girls attractive youre kidding yourself


edit to add
or you just were fed up with fighting with your bf and your subconscious is telling you to break up
 nta

you didnt say anything even slightly upsetting 

the fact of the matter is that maddie is not your mothers d and the heirlooms are being passed down through your mothers family 

maddie might have a case to be upset if these heirlooms were passed down thru your dads family but they are not 

maddie is 17 she knows how this stuff works
so you guys havent been together all that long 
is there any truth to him saying if it wasnt for the baby you wouldnt be together  or was he just saying that to hurt you because you hurt him 

is his need to get rich now a new thing maybe hes stressing about what he thinks should be his role as provider for the family now with the baby on the way 

the thing is starting his own business is going to take all of his time to get going when is he gonna have time to be a dad get to know his baby give you a break from work and parenthood 

your text was a bit rough but the basic message needed to be said 
you should have had a serious talk about what you see the future like 

be the bigger person and go talk to him get this settled or itll keep coming up again and again
how long are you two together
do they have a registry 

if i could afford it for sibs id go with something big car seat stroller high chair etc 

if i couldnt afford that or im a younger sib who doesnt work yet or still in school id get a baby bath and fill it with bath supplies towels shampoo baby wash rubber ducky 

and diapers  theyll need lots of diapers 
but not newborn size go one or two sizes up everyone gets newborn and they grow out of them pretty quick
sorry this is gonna come off as slightly mean but what exactly are you bringing to the table

you work when youre not sleeping most of the day due to your anxiety and depression you have no hobbies not that i think its a big deal but it could make you you seem to be kind of boring 

you dont like sex but are willing if the guy is successful enough frankly that is so gross because you seem to think its a transaction take me out buy me things and ill lay back and suffer while you do your thing 

yet youre looking for a guy who by your own admission seemingly has everything going for him oh and this guy has to put you on a pedestal 

ask yourself why this imaginary wish list guy would want to be with you 

youre going about this all wrong 

relationships take time and you have to put in the time stop looking for prince charming and find your own prince one who melds into your life not one who comes ready made with a lifestyle that you think you deserve 
build that lifestyle together 

just something to think about
can i ask what you mean by you work when you get the motivation 

do you not work full time have your own business
im not really sure why location would have anything to do with laundering clothes but ill give some ideas 

im assuming you have a washing machine 

you can try just adding regular laundry bleach to your wash 

for stains best thing ive found is oxyclean 
i wet the garment put a little of the powder on the stain and work it into a sort of paste let it be for a bit then launder it i add about a half scoop into the washing machine along with whatever detergent i use 

i have also soaked generally dingy whites in hot water and the oxyclean 
i try to get the oxy to dissolve add the garment leave overnight and then launder 

if you dont have a washing machine use your bathtub
im very late to the party but with regards to him mentioning his age it may be that hes saying that if you have met he may not remember it 

i think based off your lor which he read this prof probably found something in it that peaked his interest in you  was there any mention of a project you worked on with the student maybe he is just interested in your particular field maybe he just likes to meet the up and coming people in the field 

either way i think it might turn out to be a very interesting lunch think of the stories he could tell you from years back in regards to your field of study 
i had an older prof of paleontology who had the most fascinating stories of his field work

if you do end up meeting him can you update us please
nta 

if shes your friend she would already know that you have been trying to have a baby for a few years 

does she really think you would plan to be pregnant or have had a baby right around her wedding on purpose  

shes literally being a bitch right now 
and the worse part for me is that the other bridesmaids felt the need to text you who the hell do these women think they are your pregnancy is none of their or anybody elses business 

they can all just fuck right off  i wouldnt even go and even better i wouldnt even tell her im not showing up
what a wonderful thing to do 

im sure that boy was thrilled  

well done
nta

has it occurred to your h that maybe his dad doesnt want to move 

its quite normal for fil to be sad and unhappy he just lost his lifelong spouse 

but it may be that being in their home brings him some amount of comfort 
it did for my mil and my stepdad

your h and his dad just have to go through the grieving process it may take some time but they will get to where they are back to a new normal 
it takes time there is no rushing it 

your h doesnt want to hear it now but youre absolutely right his dad should not be making any major decisions this soon
sorry but if mom has issues and the child who is still very young isnt in school and is spending 24 hrs with an unstable person then yes its much safer and better for the wellbeing of the child to be placed elsewhere until mom can get the help she needs 

its not like the 7 yo can raise a red flag for himself 

better they make the call and a trained impartial person can go and assess if all is ok 

if it is then great  everything goes back to the way it is 

but if its not then both mom and child get the help they need
im not saying you should go but heres a thought 

you should ask him to find out what the schedule actually is surrounding the wedding what activities does he have to be there for if any 

have him ask the groom what the seating is like sometimes the bridal party is sat at one table together with their dates or is there a get together prior to the wedding for the bridal party and their dates youll meet the other plus ones who if youre not seated with your bf youll be with the other plus ones but youll have already met them 

i cant imagine theres something wedding related every day for a week 

if theres a few days he needs to do wedding things then you visit your family if theres days hes free then you guys can explore the city together
i only buy audiobooks for books that i have read 
i put them on when cleaning or driving or cooking or on a bluetooth when i shower 

its my background so i dont have to really listen so intently to get the story since i already know it if that makes sense 

if i listen to an audiobook that is new to me i wouldnt be able to do anything else because id have to pay attention to whats going on in the story
if your d stayed home from may to dec did she even have any income that would require her to file income taxes 

call me crazy but if she didnt  pay any income tax because she didnt work and stayed home with her kid while also pregnant theres no way she can get a refund 

i think youre fine but id check to see what would happen if she also files and you both get audited what will you need to show to prove you and not her supported this child

keep the refund you earned it
i had read about this before so heres the answer 



i loved those blankets took one home with each child
when you feel its the right time and the other person feels its the right time 

but please pay attention to what your kids think and say about this person 
if they have any apprehension at all about you pairing up or spending time with your partner take a step back and introduce very slowly 

in other words dont force your kids to accept this person it will never work in the long term
trust me i know more about planning than i ever thought i would need to 

just some people find it off putting in the beginning until they realize how good it can be 

and youre right about dates when dating
heres a thought it takes some planning but it might help 

pick a night youd be ok having sex when he comes home or even during the day let him know sex is on the table for early evening ill guess hed shower since thats his usual and while you finish getting dinner ready have him hang out in the kitchen with you or he cooks whoever does whatever 

he should since he knows whats coming be flirty and affectionate with you and since you need that romancing itll set the tone 

then by a decent hour you guys have your fun hes happy youre happy and then you can do your night routine and get to bed at a decent time to get enough sleep  and he can play his games while youre having a bath if he still want to play afterwards 

i get that planning sexy time seems idk weird strange but sometimes its just what needs to happen
sorry but as someone who has a hard line at cheating he is totally justified in not wanting anything to do with you 
thats my one and done 

you lost this good one learn from that 

now figure out why you allow yourself to get so trashed when you go out he didnt get you smashed you allowed that to happen
you met this guy for 1 month

he went back home way across the planet 

did you really think hes going to want to be in an exclusive long distance texting relationship with you  

why would you even want that 

the smartest thing you did was cut him off for both of you now you can both find someone that you can have a real relationship with
yta 

not only a huge ah but youre insane to boot 

who the hell do you think you are asking your supposed friends to wake up early to practice hair and make up for your stupid wedding 

these are grown ass woman who i am sure know how to do their hair and make up 

they dont need to practice and they dont have to make any sacrifices for your wedding 

leave them alone or you wont have any friends
no
does hayley have any friends  it may be that she doesnt have anyone else to talk to vent to or ask advice of if not she needs to get out there and meet other woman or ideally other moms  

so she relies on the only people she knows 

does she even want to live in switzerland shes only been there less than a year no 

id maybe have a talk with her and explain that you and your mom cannot be the ones to solve her marriage problems 
its does no good to have the whole family involved in personal matters 
she needs to talk to her h about these things 

if she thinks its bad enough they can get some counseling be prepared with a counseling service because shell undoubtedly have no clue where to go 

i wouldnt write her off just yet shes had a lot of changes in a short amount of time she might feel a bit like a fish out of water and shes floundering
barely having arguments just isnt a good enough basis for moving so fast 

you barely know this woman it takes longer than 6 mo to really get to know someone  is her behavior in this instance a taste of whats to come  idk and neither do you 

add to that she made you cut out your best woman friend that alone tells me shes a lot more controlling than you are allowing yourself to admit 

look im just saying slow things down a lot 

you say you both came out of abusive and toxic relationships so i have to wonder if you would recognize a healthy one youre so used to a bad one those old familiar patterns may seem normal to you
youve been together 6 mo and are already engaged 

she has a best male friend you have never met 

accused you of cheating after dinner and took a pic of your lips

 gave you the silent treatment and wont even look at you 

this isnt the happily ever after you think it is
its going to take her a long time to undo whats been ingrained in her mindset for so long but good for her for getting help 

maybe you can ask the therapist if it would be ok for you to put some small decisions back on her but only if the therapist says its ok 
small ones like what other brand to buy have a code word or phrase when she calls and you can answer with something like  i trust you to make the decision there is no wrong choice so feel free to decide 
it validates her while also encouraging her to make these small decisions 

now of course youre not going to tell her if the brand or product or choice she made is wrong youre going to have to just go with it even if you dont like it thats a sure fire way to set her back 

she will see that she doesnt have to defer to you for everything and there are no adverse consequences to that
the problem with hs mental health issues is that he hasnt actually had much legitimate help for it 

he went to a real therapist for a bit anybody know why he stopped
but after that he went on a crusade of trying to heal himself through some very unconventional means 

he doesnt want to actually get better  he thinks hes perfectly healthy he has it all figured out 

didnt he say something like  paraphrasing here he wanted the whole fam to get therapy so they could understand that they are the problem they need to be made to see that they are the bad guys they treated his wife wrong they didnt protect them  whatever the f that means they drove them out of the fam they made it untenable for them to stay etc etc etc 
as if him and the witch werent culpable at all 

he is just so out of touch with reality
she probably didnt remember any of it and her bf had to tell her how she acted 

shes mortified about her behavior and is probably avoiding having to talk to you especially after she read your text 

maybe give her another day or two and text her again just ask how shes doing and see if she answers you 

i wonder if the bf actually put her out
i saw a woman win over 1 million on a wheel of fortune game in atlantic city

she was seriously shocked she said she doesnt usually gamble had no idea what to do just hit max bet
i wouldnt hug when youre introduced just give a wave and say hi its not to meet you  

since you havent been around kids just think of them as small people 
you must have some idea what they like from their dad so ask about those 

and dont disparage anything they say you might not like snakes but the kid has a pet snake for example you dont say snakes are gross you say ive never been around a snake and you talk about feeding it and caring for it etc 

just be yourself dont be too quiet but dont take over the conversation either 

dont rush this is only step one slow and steady is the best way to go
hawaii 

never had a huge interest in going but we did and it was beautiful 
lots to see and do or you can just enjoy the beach 

its also kind of expensive so a honeymoon splurge is justified
were retired 

its only that organized out of necessity really 

a couple years ago they went off in the middle of the night of course no fire but we couldnt get them to stop so had to get the fire dept out 

after that my h started putting the install dates on them and this last episode we figured since the batteries were being changed might as well date them too 
and theyre only hard wired cause we had an addition put on years ago and had to bring it all up to code
we change ours every daylight savings time but we did it about a month ago 

mine are hard wired and went off one night but it stopped and then went off again  not the beep the actual fire fire

so after realizing theres no fire we set out to figure out which detector was faulty 

in that process we changed every battery and a few of the older detectors 

of course the last one we had to check was the one that was faulty this detector was 10 years old  none of the other ones in the whole house were as old most were about 3 years old have no idea why we never changed out this one 

so now every detector has a date written on it when it was installed and every battery also has the date we replaced them 

oh and detectors usually only have a lifespan of 10 years
seriously its been 2 years and shes still not over her ex 

its not like shes just pining away secretly shes  actively trying to meet up with him 

do you want to be her placeholder until this guy decides he wants her back and she dumps you 

im sure theres someone out there who actually wants to be with you cause this girl isnt it
 just to mention they could have had the cruise line book them up to two days prior to embark date ncl has that option 

of course that means they have to have more days off and pay for hotels and meals for those days so a lot of people cant do that or just dont want to 

personally i would never fly in on day of embark especially with an international flight its just too risky 

and travel insurance is great for this scenario but the dissapointment of missing my vacation needs to be taken into consideration also
because it doesnt make any sense 

fed student loans were never going to cover the full cost of college 
the maximum loan that can be taken out thru the govt is 31000 divided over 4 years 

in the big picture this isnt a crippling amount people end up with huge debt because they then go out and get private loans for the balance or their parents take out parent loans with the agreement that the student pay it back


so the govt makes the loan the student graduates and pays back the loan with interest 

the act of repaying this loan plus the interest is then used to fund the next batch of students that need them 

cancelling 10000 or 20000 for pell grant recipients of loans is essentially taking away some of the ability of this loan program to fund itself 
so that means the govt  essentially every taxpayer is paying for this relief

i have a definite problem with continuing a program that  basically has no funding source other than more spending 

the govt is making loans to incoming freshman for sept of this year where is that money coming from  

so we cancel some amount now but what about graduates in 2024 and beyond do they get some relief too 

look i get the economy isnt great i have 3 kids that have this debt 

how about we ensure that students who took these loans satisfy their legal obligation they may have a few tough years as they begin their careers and life but it isnt like every other generation hasnt had mostly the same exact scenario 

of course some had it better at times but that is simply because of what was happening at the time and the economy and jobs and salaries all have ups and downs
oh yeah youre fine then 
i thought it was a not seeing her ever thing 

but rethink the wedding mostly so your h doesnt have to go alone and he doesnt get all the qs about where you are from everyone unless he doesnt care then youre good

im pretty sure shes the type that wont even notice youre there too busy being fawned over by her bridesmaids or yelling at the caterer
while i agree she sounds unreasonableim trying to be nice
the fact is that she is marrying into your husbands family 

which means whether you want to associate with her or not there are going to be times when you will be around her think holidays inlaw bdays children bdays family weddings not hers funerals etc 

so you have to decide how youre going to navigate all this without having the rest of the family get on your case for it 

the wedding you and h should go its his bro your parents should decline  idk why they would even want to go they babysit for you that night 

the shower you decline and just say youre working that weekend they dont need to know its on call or whatever 

any other occasions you go your inlaws are not going to take kindly to never seeing their son on a holiday because you dont like sil and maybe your h wants to spend some time with his parents 
you say hi and bye and be civil 

theres ways to navigate thru this
thanks for the update 

amazing that they admit its their issue and still refused to refund 

good on you for going higher 

heres hoping the refund comes soon 

have a great trip
so i found this recipe



im not so sure its a bad meal as its 285 cal for a 4 oz serving of the beef 
just trim any remaining fat which i think youd do anyway 

but it has a very high salt content according to this



the first recipe is how i cook mine
just put it in a pot and boil i add the cabbage and potatoes pretty much after the beef is cooked because i dont like when they get really mushy 
i cook the vegs just until the potatoes are soft and the cabbage is cooked thru but slightly firm
i cant help with spring break stuff but if you really have to go to key west rent a car 

miami to key west is a 4 hour drive 
and orlando to key west is a 6 hour drive 
idk where youre flying into
absolutely agree with everything you wrote 

but i didnt mean to imply drop them at the club all day long it seems a lot of people thought thats what i meant
so to expand on that 

just if the choice is roam free or kids club id opt kids club at least the first few days for a bit to have a chance to meet other kids 
and i said if he meets a buddy and wants to do something else have the boy set a time and him and buddy can go do that or those things 

and if he has a phone even better he can text where theyre gonna go next 
were done here going for ice cream or in the pool or wherever so at least the parents have an idea of where he is 

i think thats fair gives him a bit of free movement without mom or dad tagging along but hes with a buddy or two and can get small doses of roaming free  but somewhat controlled if that makes sense
so just so im clear

this is on government  or company issued devices 

if thats the case i dont have a problem with it 

what am i missing if anything 

i know about china tracking and all that but theres got to be more to it since theres such a ruckus around it
nta

the main thing is that this is passed on through your moms family 

your dad and especially your half sis from him have zero connection to your moms side 

thats your out this is from moms side not dads 
tell her to have her grandparents write down their recipes she can have that 

youre not even close with this half sister so i have no idea why shed even care
i wouldnt let a 10 yo roam around alone 
the kids club is where he should be 

if he meets a friend in the club and they want to do something specific like go to the arcade do the ropes course etc then he needs to ask if he can do that at a specific time 

so maybe dont put him in the club at that time but they meet up where theyre gonna go to meet the friend and then they go off but id walk him to the meeting place and at least meet the other kid 

does he have a phone so he can at least tell you where he is like after the arcade were going for ice cream then were going wherever
nta
your wife is being a bad mother in regards to your sons health 

your wife just doesnt want to admit that your son is unwell 
so its up to you now to help your son 

go to your son and ask him what he wants to do he seems to relate better to you anyway 

is that therapy or meds not painkillers more along the lines of an anti depressant or does he just want a semester off to stay home get out in nature or just have no stress 

dont dictate what he should be doing 

he knows hes unwell he probably has some idea what he needs at this moment 

then facilitate doing what he wants to do for himself
she was granted legal custody and the dad asked for no visitation 

but dad was ordered to pay support 

so ill guess the court didnt decide visitation because he said he didnt want it 
now he and his whole family suddenly wants to see the son
i really hate that every time i hear of a dog attack i automatically think its a pit bull 
but it is always a pit bull 

i keep hearing that these dogs are really sweet when trained well but these dogs were bred to be vicious 

so even if its a well trained dog there can  be circumstances where the dog will revert back to its basic instinct of being vicious 

i dont know what circumstance this could be but it seems to happen
anyone else just curious why exactly
 his parents need a 
   
   no doing dangerous things in the house 

rule to begin with 

yta
stop doing dangerous things in your parents house or you wont have a house or parents to come home to
why do you want to be married to someone who is not in love with you 

how can you look at him a guy who lied and cheated pretty much the whole time you are together and not be absolutely disgusted by what you see  that alone would make me lose any love i had for him 

dont sacrifice any more of your dignity and pride for a guy who will cheat andor move on from you when he finds something better in a heartbeat
i am a parent although mine are out of school now 

i would not allow anyone associated with the school to touch my childs personal laptop 

if the school is so worried they can give my child a laptop that only allows access to approved sites for schoolwork only 

id ask your parents about this whole scenario
totally agree 

shes pushing back school so she can go on vacation with money they dont have 
if they have extra money for a vacation that money should be used to pay down the debt 

its understandable now why they have such debt
 nta

its really presumptuous of your bro and ex sil to tell your niece you would buy her a car or even worse that youd pay for her party 

they are her parents if they want her to have these things they can buy them 

if bro and ex own both homes why did they not divide them at the time of the divorce 

this is your bros fight to fight i wouldnt do anything either he made this mess he can figure it out 

in the event mom is forced to get out then you can discuss with mom where she wants to live and if that means buying her a house then you do it
i really dont think i can take anymore of her truth 

now if she wants to admit to the truth i might listen 

but we know shed never do that it will make her look bad
but do you realize that the  loan you paid off including the interest actually funded the next group of kids that need loans  

the fed govt only backed those loans so they had enough money to fund the next round of loans 

i have  kids that are all paying off their loans of course they stopped when it was on pause but i told all of them to make sure they didnt spend that amount of their budget for when they had to start repaying them

oh and my h and i paid ours off too
i agree i think first time employees need a bit of in office experience 

you def get a lay of the land that way 
you learn the in office politics and just a general how to behave in an office setting
i like seeing them its kind of fun seeing usually older couples riding 

i always think the guy was a biker back i the day maybe and he had to give it up so this is the closest hell
 come to riding 

and he has his partner with him its nice
oahu was absolutely gorgeous  
enjoy
 the med on a cruise italy greece turkey montenegro

spending a few days in rome then doing a trans atlantic back to fla 

its my longest vacation cannot wait
just find a teenager in the neighborhood to watch your kids at your home while your wife works and ask your parents for the every other weekend or whatever their schedule can do 

paying might cut into the amount of money your wife is making but you dont really have a choice do you 

even if you get the kids in daycare is your wife really going to be making enough money to cover it 
if its just a matter of her wanting to work put the little one in daycare while the 5 yo is in school and she can work those hours 

your wife cannot be mad at your parents im sure it sounded good at the time but the reality was it was unsustainable long term for them
and thats what you should have said at the time 

i also went to one store and found mine also only tried on a few 
but i had been looking thru brides magazine  do they still have that for months i kept coming back to the same one 
and it was the one and 33 years later i still love it
nah this person will not care what anyone else has to say 

take what responses you have gotten here and decide for yourself what your next move should be 

this is your life dont leave it up to someone who belittles you 

look at what 5pinktoes has to say about the power imbalance she is spot on  
you have none if you stay
all of this is really odd 

why does he even care how long it took you to find a dress  he should be thrilled now you wont be stressing that  youre never gonna find one that happens a lot 

for him to get mad over this is uncalled for 
does he frequently get mad over trivial things maybe that should be a conversation
youre not being sensitive 

every one of those examples are meant to demean you the person saying them seems to have a very high opinion of themselves and you wont ever measure up to them 

this person will not change they will not understand how these words bother you  ever 

i wouldnt put up with it
slight yta 

i understand  that in your experience laying it out so bluntly has been the way to shut down any debate but i think you should have  and in the future should explain the reasoning once if a debate ensues or your explanation is questioned then you go nuclear 

in other words nice first then nuclear 

and hey dont stress its one day it will be wonderful even if not perfect 
nothing is ever perfect 
when you feel stressed take a step back calm yourself and then go back to it   one thing one decision at a time
suppers done roast beef 

to let d know
you were only dating the first girl for a little over a month so i do not think theres anything wrong with breaking up with her to start dating another 

thats the point of dating you date you break up when you find someone else you like better 

i would suggest not becoming exclusive with anyone until you date for longer than a month and get to know that person better as you found out you really didnt like the way the first girl treated you 

take your time with the new girl dont go all in until youve dated for a while and make sure she is someone you have an actual real connection with 

and really get a hold of your emotions you should not be upset because you may have caused someone to be sad its going to happen doesnt make you a bad person 
and frankly the first girl doesnt sound like such a nice person with the way she spoke to you 

any partner is going to at times say something you dont like but its in those times that you think about what caused them to say it reflect and ask yourself if its justified and fight the times it is not and admit when it is
first off dont have the open relationship talk until you have exhausted every other possible solution  keep in mind even if she says ok she may not be and she will be home with your child while youre out with another woman which could then lead to a complete breakdown of your marriage 
tread very carefully here 

so its been 4 years and she hasnt given you any explanation 

explain to her that she can no longer put off having this conversation 

theres obviously something going on with her and you need to know what it is it is not fair to you or the relationship that shes not willing to discuss a fundamental issue that you feel you are having 

yes of course caring for the baby is important but not to the detriment of the marriage there needs to be a balance 

start there and see what she says and where the conversation goes
did you ask why what did she say the reason is 

im surprised you stayed that long 

do you miss really her or do you just miss the idea of having someone in your life  your whole schedule is all changed up maybe you just need to get into a new normal
humans need physical touch we need to feel intimacy with our partners it almost seems cruel to me that shed withhold cuddling and kissing 
does she think you really cannot control yourself thats insulting 

do i have it right that she just decided after 6 mo of dating to no longer have sex  because you were together 1 12 yrs but havent had sex in 1 yr
nta

wear what you like and have her son tell his mom that shes crossing a line with trying to dictate what you both wear 

i liked showers better when the bride or mom to be had no idea and was surprised 

your mil would have had a stroke if she saw what i wore to mine 
i didnt even know it was my shower so it was leggings and a long sweater with sneakers  
i dont think so id think they arent really hot 

like this



these are a bit pricey so id shop around
 nta at all 

candles are dangerous and a 10 yo really cannot grasp the absolute seriousness of if something goes wrong 

anyway buy her a few of the battery operated tea lights that she can place in nice holders 
shell get the effect of candles with no risk
you know what tho its a big bday you only turn 40 once youre already splurging for the haven 

go for it  make this trip your ultra splurge for yourself im sure you deserve it live it up  

and one other tip if you drink red wine the eastwest red blend is really good its an ncl proprietary blend
and the gerard bertrand cab is also really good
figure out realistically how many drinks you are going to have from the premium list 
add in the cost of the excursions youre looking at taking and see if 
the cost works out to even close to what youd pay extra then id say yea 


if you really only like one or two baileys after dinner lets say then it might be cheaper to just pay for those few drinks 

and if youre gonna sit on a beach a few times or can excursions for much cheaper maybe not

and your sis can get the unlimited wifi that she wants 

its all really a money numbers game  
but with sis not drinking i dont think youre gonna come close to it making money sense that extra  300 vs just paying gratuities on the regular free at sea drink pkg makes a big diff i would think
i think a trip to dmv would be the next step hopefully you can get a decent person there that can help you track down where your license physically is right now 

maybe they can cancel that license and reissue one to your new address 

try having your license showing the physical address but your paperwork having a mailing address  the po box 

i know dmv  is the absolute last place you want to go but i would think thats the best way 

as far as the paperwork id use my married name show the ss card and ins card 
id make sure my insurance is in the married name like your ss card 
what do ppl who dont have dls do i wonder 
if they need more show the ss married nameold dl  maiden and marriage certificate  connect the two to prove youre the same person
take a look at this page 

im looking into using this transport from livorno its 35 each
but you have to get to livorno town from the port 


what they mean is you have the original invoice which shows the lower amount that you paid and shows you owe a zero balance 

that is your proof that you paid what was due 

your lower priced invoice should have a date on it and you can show that you paid the amount on the day you booked 

i would call them it doesnt seem like they actually understood what you were asking them 
they told you it was paid in full  it didnt mention anything about why the amounts changed 
make sure you explicitly say that you have an original invoice with a diff dollar amount 

im grasping at straws right now but

it looks like its the ksf discount is it possible the child discount is dependent on the age of the child and once you corrected your sons bday it put him into a diff age category so the discount is different idk never heard it being done that way
thats what they just dont get 

they get elected and vote or support whatever their own personal opinion is on an issue or they just go along with the party line whether they agree with it or not or whether we agree with it or not 

how about they start listening to what their constituents want we elected them to do what we want not whatever it is they want 

these people are supposed to be our voice
since you have your original confirmation you can ask them to go over each charge one by one to find the difference 

just throwing this out 
did they maybe add on their cruise insurance  you dont have to get it but i would strongly advise you have some kind of insurance

or did they add in the daily service charge which doesnt have to be pre paid but will be billed to your onboard acct each day you sail
that is a cop out answer im sure she loves her kitchen at home the best but do you want your reception in her living room  

does he really want his mom cooking the day of his wedding  all day

does she even realize that shes going to miss her sons wedding by being in the kitchen 
is she gonna take the apron off for the mother son dance at least 

come on im sure shes a great cook but she can leave the cooking to someone else and just enjoy the day
you work and hes a house boyfriend 

but hes your house boyfriend who doesnt live with you 

so basically youre supporting some guy who you dont know and somehow think this is an actual relationship 

and you think its perfectly reasonable to buy him a car and not just any car a luxury car 

and you think the biggest problem in this whole scenario is that his parents are going to think some other imaginary girl bought him the car he just magically shows up with one day
esh

he got mad that you werent looking at him while he was trying to show you something

but  he must not have been looking at you when he started this conversation about something you should look at  or else he would have known you were looking at something else 

so he cant complain you werent looking when neither was he 

this is a stupid argument anyway
my doc told me to just take vitamin d and calcium 

i think were trying to see if it will stave of osteoporosis 

my mom was on fosomax for osteoporosis and didnt have any side effects this was a while ago tho idk if theres newer drugs
a nice photo album of the two of you through the years if you have any special thoughts on what was going on in the pictures you can write them in 
show him what all those years meant to you by having him in them 

and of course the obligatory 1 dad shirt or coffee mug

i had barely knew my future mil when we got engaged of course we met but we didnt spend very much time together 

my mother had one rule 
she and only the the bride to be would be going dress shopping she paid for out dress and it was a motherdaughter thing 
no friends no sisters  i have 3 no anybody else 
none of the mils had a problem with this once it was explained and my mil only had boys so she would never get that experience 

now i also have 2 brothers and saw how mom was left out of any wedding planning 
so i invited my mil to the food tasting at the catering hall just me and her h was workingand brought and showed her everything we were debating on i wanted her to feel involved it was her sons wedding also 

your sil and mil are out of order definitely no argument there but mil may feel hurt and sil is fighting her battle which she shouldnt 

so maybe just try to be a little more open with some of the other wedding planning you dont have to take her picks or advice but at least make her feel like she is in the know so to speak and remember its her sons wedding also she just doesnt want to show up and have no idea what its gonna be like
nta

i absolutely love your idea 
it showed everyone what was involved and exactly why they couldnt handle it 

and bravo for handling the grandparents brilliant 

i think your h should be the one telling the kids he can explain why it wasnt a good idea at this time mostly because he couldnt keep up with the conditions 

he might mention it wouldnt be very fair to mom who doesnt want the dog if she got stuck taking care of it as an added bonus
i agree 

why william would ever want to even talk to h after such a betrayal is beyond me some things you just dont come back from and what h has done is one of them can you even imagine the deep hurt w feels coming from his only sibling 

i can see charles wanting some sort of relationship he is his son after all but i would like to think even charles realizes it needs to be a distant check in how you doing sort of relationship kind of like you dont wish any harm but you dont go out of your way to be close 

charles aside harry has to be seriously delusional if he thinks anyone in his family is going to want any kind of relationship with him and the wife not a snowbells chance in hell 

they had to pick a lane and they picked celebrity over family at the expense of family 
now they have neither the quicker they realize that the better
from one 30 married to another ive always said thats the secret 

of course we love each other but we actually like each other thats a big distinction isnt it one im not sure some people understand 

wishing your husband a speedy recovery and more happy years to the both of you
yeah sorry none of that is even remotely ok especially that disrespectful bs with the picture can he not have an adult conversation 

is it a matter of him not having any money but then he should have at least acknowledged the day 
does he not do anything for any special day at all 

you need a serious come to jesus talk with him how exactly does he see you and this relationship is he in love with you or did this pairing just move along until you had a child together and it evolved to where you are now 

sorry to be so blunt 

take a good hard look at your relationship im gonna take a guess and say this pairing is much more beneficial for him than it is for you
the best way to act in this situation 

you reconcile this is your own head as you had a good time while it lasted but its run its course 

youve been long distance with periods of not seeing each other and now hes moving even farther away do you really want to keep this up a few days together every once in a while 
how about finding a guy who lives near you that you can actually try to have a future with
info please 

ok you had the conversation but what did he say was the reason he did not do anything for v day 

we need to know what his mindset is before we can actually give any advice
 it wasnt your moms fault 

your mom just brought up some uncomfortable things that you and your partner should have been discussing anyway since you didnt your partner had time to think thru the issues your mom brought up and came to a conclusion that it wouldnt work 

was your gf supposed to go vegetarian and learn hindi your mom points this out but you dont actually say if this is what you wanted also 
long distance is hard your mom maybe didnt want you two separated for that long she likes your gf didnt want to see you break up 
the dream may not have happened but it made your gf really think if she could fit in with your culture 

i dont think your mom had any bad intentions your just sad and want to blame someone

did anyone really need a study to know this
i love a good full salad 

but i hate all the chopping that goes into it so i make a huge salad that can last about 3 days so as long as its readily available ill eat it 

maybe try that make a basic salad that you can add diff things to it to at least make it slightly diff each time
the problem i see with even trying to have a conversation about his weight is that he knows hes overweight and hes probably embarrassed by it 

so i wouldnt harp on it too much for fear of making him feel even worse about it if he thinks you only care about how he looks instead of how he feels that will add to his feeling bad about himself  not saying you do this just that kids might twist it to that 

maybe just a gentle  hey kiddo covid lockdowns really did a number on all of us i worked so much i didnt really see what was going on with you or your bro im sorry im not judging you at all but we both have to realize that your weight is unhealthy if you want to or need help figuring out what we can do im here ill listen and well figure it out together and if theres anything else youre struggling with and need help well get some help i just want you healthy and happy 

then leave him alone about it maybe just give him a few extra hugs 
he knows what he has to do and he has a world of info with the internet if he wants to do it himself

editing after seeing some of op replies

therapy would be great but only if hes ok with it otherwise hell just refuse to talk he seems to have a lot going on teens seem to be coming out of covid with mental health issues add to that his confusion of his sexuality and its a lot for a teen to deal with 

have you taken him for a full physical covid weight gain is real but thats a lot of weight maybe theres a medical reason id at least rule that out
nta
lets see if mom is willing to support her 

i get the whole dont make her pay cause im the parent and all that 
but that only works as long as you can afford it 

what kind of child sees a parent struggle and still isnt willing to help 

a selfish one 

your d needs to be on her own for a while shell get a dose of real life
im not judging at all 

just saying theres a lot missing from the info they put out 

i can see the 5 yo being with a parent getting gas perfectly fine so i wondered were they in the car caught in a crossfire or were they being babysat by one of the other teens and brought to a party not good 

how did it get that we have to actually teach our kids that we dont try to kill anyone we have a problem with its a nuclear option to use sad really
right

so there was an altercation at a party that spilled over to the gas station 
did someone bring the 5 yo to the party 
was the 5 yo there with a parent maybe and got caught in the crossfire  but why would the child be out of the car 

so many questions
time lots of time 
you need to date someone until you know them really know them 

we rush into relationship ships because we want someone anyone were so afraid of falling behind our friends our peers that we take good enough instead of good 

no guy is totally going to revolve his whole life around youc
yea hes being mean and unhelpful to boot 

he needs to get out of that habit before your child gets older little people need lots of help finding their stuff
ok  nta

whatever she did with it she should have picked it up i dont care how busy she is shes been in that bathroom at least a couple of times over the 2 days 

and then to yell at you and threaten no sex over it thats a massive over reaction 

time for a little chat about disrespect of your spouse
did she leave her bra in the shower or just in the bathroom

how did it get soaking wet
i heard it a couple days ago its heartbreaking to think that no one did anything for the boy 

but i also wondered why the coaches were not required to know cpr 
even if not you try  you have 911 walk you thru it just something 

i was a cub scout leader and volunteered as a coach for my kids grade school and it was required of every parent coach or for scouts every leader 

thank goodness mine are grown or now id be staying thru every practice and game
im so confused 
you dated kate but never met her family for 4 years how you must have lived in the same neighborhood if you went to the same hs 

next you break up with kate during college and what change colleges to the one thats a state over maybe things happen 

then you meet julia who wont let you meet her fam because she went nc because they sent her away where to take care of her sister would this be kate 

you finally meet julias fam who turn out to be kates fam and what do you know julia also lives in your old neighborhood  
and instead of acknowledging to the parents that you and kate had dated for 4 yrs before you met julia you say nothing you tell julia and shes just hunky dory about it 
and kate just happens to let this cat out of the bag that she had been pregnant in college not exactly what his think would be dinner convo but whatever 

then you yell at kate because why 

so i call bs on all of it
so heres my very rudimentary explanation i dont own a gun 

the us is a relatively young country and when it was first discovered there was nothing except for the indian settlements but there was vast wilderness 

guns have always had a place in our country because they were a means of survival had to hunt for food protect land and animal stock and yes even protection from horse rustlers and robbers 

so then we fight for our independence from a country who had a national army 
way back we had no central army  we had 13 colonies spread far apart and communication would take days so even if we wanted a central army it wasnt feasible so each state had its own militia to be used in case of attack by a foreign army 
thats why it was written into the constitution as a right to bear arms we were determined not to be ruled over again 

as the country became more industrialized and modern there were and still are very rural places where some people need to shoot prey animals you have to realize just how big this country is there are still vast swathes of undeveloped wilderness 

there are also people who move from those very rural places to suburbia or cities who genuinely enjoy going to a range and practicing their skill it was there way of life after all or they just enjoy hunting 

so while mass shootings are mostly done by someone who it later turns out had bought a legal gun you have to remember that the everyday random violence is mostly perpetrated by criminals who do not buy guns legally and that gets us into a whole other conversation 

so you cant bar someone from legally buying a gun in most cases it is their right but you also cannot stop them from using it to commit crimes 
theres lots of ideas going around but outright banning gun sales is never going to happen
while your stat is true it needs to be put in perspective 

as per this website



we found that some 297033 children were married in the us between 2000 and 2018 232474 based on marriagecertificate data plus 64559 based on estimates table 1 a few children were as young as 10 years when they married but of those for whom age information was available nearly all96were aged 16 or 17 years of those for whom age gender and spousal information was available 78 were girls under 18 years of age wed to adult men aged 18 years or older the national number of children wed decreased each yearfrom 76396 in 2000 to 2493 in 2018 table 2but is unlikely to get to zero without legislative intervention

so 96 were 16 and 17 hardly what most people think of when they hear  child marriages 
and the number for 2018 is 2493 total out of 350 million people 


in comparison

one out of every five marriages in iran is a child marriage
a total of 550565 marriages were registered in march 2018 to march 2019 in 112647 cases the bride was ages 17 years or less more than a fifth of marriages registered in iran during that year were therefore child marriages by unicefs measurefeb 9 2020
  features
twenty percent of marriages in iran are child marriages
iran has a population of about 85 million people 

from the same article 

data from the national organization for civil registration records that around 1100 girls under the age of 12 were married in 20172018 more recently the figure has been around 2600 girls this is in the range of two or three marriages per thousand registered throughout the year  which is a large and significant number considering the legal obligation to secure court approval the law permits a judge to issue a marriage license in all such cases when it is expedient to do so


now i condone any marriage to a child in any country in any circumstance but two 16 or 17 yos who find themselves pregnant marrying each other is very diff  than a  12 and under literal child marrying a grown man
how long were you dating before you moved in
it hasnt even been a year that youve been together which means you havent even scratched the surface of really getting to know this person 

it isnt all about love thats part of the problem you think that just because he loves you hes going to think of your wants and needs all the time hell be appreciative of any little thing you do for him and the household
youre under the impression that the two of you are working toward something and that all he has to do is talk to you and all will be magically better 

but the reality is hes a depressed guy who wont do anything about it and just wants to get lost in his games so he doesnt have to deal with real life 

next time he tells you to leave do it 
save yourself and get out before you waste more time with someone who seemingly adds no value to your life
thank you  lots of good info 
that sounds like my kind of cruise
what youre failing to realize is that the only reason you want him back in your life is that you are struggling with making connections with other people 

thats you being selfish 

you didnt like lily because she was in effect taking kaleb away from you you didnt want to share him 
now id say you probably didnt intentionally kill her because thats just too out there 

but you also didnt try to keep your dad and family from threatening to destroy kalebs life either did you 
you cant claim it was just your dad you were an adult at the time 

you didnt give kaleb time to properly mourn his gf someone who he cared for and probably felt extremely guilty that he was the one who brought her to the dinner that ultimately killed her 

you wanted him to just forget about her and concentrate all his energy on you and when he didnt you and your dad tried to rush him along and when that didnt work and he lashed out you essentially had him run out of town 

stop looking for him if he wanted anything to do with you im sure he knows exactly where to find you
i am extra careful around mirrors and will not walk under a ladder 

i always say you never know so ill follow the superstition just in case 

now i have to stop putting my pocketbook on the floor never heard that one
have you been on any other lines and can you compare them 
im not too worried about the food im not a foodie so unless something is clearly inedible im fine 

what was the sea day activities like and the night shows and casino 

oh and i also liked pic 4  
are you a photographer because id never even think to take that shot yet its pretty great
i think the earlier suggestion of seeing if any of the other people in these photos want them 

really nobody in the fam is going to want to look at them from a viewpoint of  thats where aunt and uncle went and what did on their vacay but the friends they went with might want to relive those memories 

of course keep any that have no nudity in them landscapes signs etc so that youd have a timeline of their travels if anyone would really want to know 

just a thought
i dont want to come off as mean 

but were you really tricked
you really thought a 52 yo  when he started dating you at 28 father of 3 adult children would have wanted to start all over again with a baby 

some might but the majority wont 
he wanted to date a much younger woman to stroke his ego 

if you want a child do yourself a huge favor and find a man closer to your age who actually wants to have and be involved in raising his child
oh great  now well have to hear all about what they got wrong 

do these two really not have any sense of humor  laugh it off once in a while
they must be fun at parties
you have a lot going on so i dont know if this will be helpful or not

but i can say that my hot flashes have on occasion come on fast and i did have the dizziness and nausea 

so that symptom may well be connected to menopause 

sorry but i cant help with anything else
weve all seen on reditt that some parents have an obvious favorite child those examples are i think more the exception than the rule 

most parents dont have a favorite but we recognize that each child has something special or different that their sibs dont have one can talk to anyone anywhere and one takes a while to open up to new people one is an athlete and one is artistic ones a spender ones a saver those things 

and when we recognize these differences we try to cultivate and encourage that thing so the child can make the most of it for themselves 

so every child is the favorite if you want to call it that in a diff category 

at least thats how i saw and did it
nta

i think its perfectly fine for parents to go away without their kids 
but you are too young to be left alone for a week and its your parents responsibility to make arrangements for someone to take care of you for the week thats what makes your parents ta 

do you have a best friend that you can stay with 

you need to make your parents understand its the leaving you home alone that is not right
i say go for it 

you really have no idea what your personal menopause is going to be like 

some woman go through it with minimal effect on their life 
others are hit hard and have a difficult time just getting thru the day 

you dont know where youre going to fall in the range and youll regret not taking this opportunity if you have an easy or even a temporary short lived hard time 

surround yourself with one or two very key employees that you can absolutely trust to have your back just in case
id give a student teacher a bit more leeway just because they are figuring out the best approach to a lesson 
but i agree the mentor teacher should have had a chat about the approach 

also keep in mind just in general teachers try to explain things in multiple ways to cover all the diff ways kids learn thats not a bad idea 
its repetitive for the ones that got it on the first explanation but invaluable for the ones that got it on the last explanation
im still not understanding 
you park your car on the street this is not a private parking lot or something is it 

is it correct to say that your car is not blocking their driveway but is parked between two driveways on the street so in front of a home 
are you parking in front of your neighbors house and thats why they are mad they do not own the street parking in front of their home can you not park in front of your own home 

i cannot imagine that a traffic officer would give you a ticket even if they have been called by the neighbor if you are not parked illegally how do you even call a traffic officer 

im not really sure what to tell you maybe take a picture of your car every time you park and then if you get a ticket take another pic with the ticket still on your car to prove the car was parked legally 

or see if you have a case for harassment on the neighbor if they keep calling the traffic police on you 

or call the traffic police yourself and ask them why they keep coming when they know you are parking legally
if you dont mind can you expand on the increase risk of cardio vascular disease please 
im trying to keep up but honestly its too much info thats constantly being contradicted day to day and not making a lot of sense 

i thought the heart issues came about from the vaccine and mostly in youngish people
your gf is insane none of this is normal 

she knows her big v day gift is a play she got a smaller gift on v day to mark that day you asked what she wanted to do on that day and did it with her

none of that was enough

she still wanted you to acknowledge and recognize your past failure on gift giving occasions 

hell no your gf has a way over inflated opinion of her worth 

how long or how many times are you going to have to atone for past grievances 

this is your first relationship so im gonna give you the benefit of the doubt since you have nothing to compare this one to but ill tell you this this is absolutely not how a mutual respectful and healthy relationship should play out 
you should not be tiptoeing around her trying not to upset her 

take a long hard look at what she adds to your life ill bet not much 

do you frequently feel as tho you arent doing enough do her wants and needs count for more than your own have you ever really wanted to do something or go somewhere that she didnt and you gave in 

simply put shes treating you like shit and youre taking it and asking for more please time to send her packing
it could be as simple as keeping the good stuff he really had no reason to keep your clothes or nick nacks 

or he just couldnt be bothered to pack it up and ship it 

even if you pay for him to ship it he may just keep the money and not ship it anyway 

dont read too much into it 

just write him and the keyboard off get yourself a new keyboard
youre 2 months in it is totally unrealistic for her to be able to say whether she sees a future with you 

so early on is the honeymoon phase you and her need time in order to tell if this is a long term thing or not you have to really know the other person warts and all as the saying goes 

work on your anger issues and see how it goes 

dont pressure her to commit long term this early it comes off as insecure needy and obsessive
she should have some idea that an engagement is in her future so its not out of the ordinary to scroll some websites together and see what she likes and doesnt like 

you can then ask if she wants to pick out the exact one or if she trusts you enough to pick one on your own 

we never even discussed rings at all and i love mine i looked at it like  he got what he wanted me to have she may want you to do that also 
just ask her
 i have to say that in this instance i cant imagine you would even want to see your father for a while due to your own anger at after the way he treated your mom 

and its not a taking sides thing its more the way he went about leaving her it was unnecessarily cruel of him 

so youre nta for limiting contact at least for a while until you get your own anger and disappointment under control 

after things settle down a bit you can reach out under your terms to either see him with the kids or maybe just even have your h at your home while he visits 

hugs to your mom
are you that busy that you cant look online and save some styles you like or just take a trip to a mall and look thru all the jewelry stores there to see what they have 
decide on a few styles you like go back to the jeweler and pick one 

theres no need for a middleman
try to figure out why you are eating 

are you bored your life seems pretty active at school and when youre home youre probably bored you need to schedule more activity during the day 

or you can drink a glass of water every time you reach for food you might just be thirsty and if not it will at least fill you enough that you wont feel the need to eat right at that time 

also remember you arent burning as many calories at home that you do at school it may be that youre not even eating so many calories youre just not offsetting them with exercise
but he expects you to have 23 hours to clean after looking after the house and kids all day and going to school 

im not even sure what level of clean hes looking for  i get making sure the guest bathroom is clean for company but you could dust on monday and by tuesday night its back not as much but its there the kids toys shouldnt be scattered around the house but thats a 5 min task 

ask him what exactly he thinks will take hours
very very slight yta just for phrasing 

instead of saying normal moms

you should have said something more along the lines of  you knew we were going clubbing why didnt you have your h watch the baby for a few hours im assuming these were plans made in advance

did she ever give a reason why her h couldnt watch the baby 

im thinking this has less to do with whether she was invited or not and more to do with her mindset she feels shes not back to her pre baby weight and has nothing to wear shes has a mindset that moms dont do clubbing and shes tired so the last thing she wants to do is something active she just hasnt figured out a balance between being a mom and being her own person sometimes new moms get stuck in baby mode 

shes going to lose all her friends if she expects 7 other women are going to be happy with a social life that fully revolves around baby friendly activities
so get more video proof id put cameras in every direction ones that can pick up sound so you have everything recorded 

you put up with it for a few years you can hang on another 6 months 

its not you but escalating isnt the way to go about it and you know the second you retaliate the cops will be showing up at your door you dont need that in your life
think of it this way is it fair to the girl youre dating now to not be able to give her your all in this relationship 

no its not 

you need to tell her whats going on 
she deserves to be with someone who wants to be with her completely 
its a new thing so she likely isnt too invested yet 

and you need to take some time to get over your old relationship without dating
im not in this fight but i found this just because i was curious 



its from 2021 so i have no idea if it is was ever implemented 
also its from a womans forum so i was surprised by their stance
i think theyre asking what have you been given that isnt  sex because in a committed relationship sex will be happening 

its just worded oddly 

it cant be off the table and also given 

stay home make a nice dinner both agree to dress up for dinner something your so really likes that you wouldnt normally be comfortable going out in him too tho something you like to see him not thats not  the usual open a bottle of wine and spend the night connecting as a couple
ah see i learned something new 
thanks for the diff between the two
ah learned something new today 
thanks for the distinction
excellent point this is a key distinction 

i perceive antisocial with being more aggressive maybe  at or when meeting new people 

but someone who is or shy or introverted is just more uncomfortable amongst new people but willing to go out of their comfort zone to make new connections 

big diff in advice to be given
they wont let you bring them on when you board 
and they will take them from you when you reboard and store them from you until the end of the cruise if you buy them in port 

so basically no 

but i heard if youre cruising europe you can bring alcohol on when boarding and also from ports that they will let you keep  but you should confirm that
get a library card and use their app to borrow ebooks for your kindle 
this way youre not paying for books you might not like 

how about reading the book of a movie you enjoyed  
theres usually a lot more nuance in the book that you cant get from the movie and you already know you like the story 
that might make you more willing to set aside time to read
no its fine but do you understand the point i was trying to explain

trying to explain why trans ppl get more hate than just lgbq people
what youre missing is the baker wouldnt make a cake for the lesbian couple because he was religious and said it goes against his religious and moral convictions 

idk anything about the gender one tho but im guessing probably the same reason but thats a guess
its not a matter of not agreeingwith lgbtq  at this point we all should know that there are people who have diff sexualities 

but trans ppl arent as simple as a diff sexuality they are in a whole other place having more to do with gender than sexuality so i think that confuses people who dont understand how that can be so its as if they dont understand it it cant be true in a sense 

adding to that is young and really young kids claiming to be trans and all the medical treatments they are being given at such young ages doesnt sit well with a lot of people theres a feeling that its too much too soon 
is it right or wrong i have no idea 

then add in all the controversy of what bathroom to use sports competition moral issues like the baker and other businesses situation and it just becomes an us vs them fight  and this is what were seeing now
i liked it  im not a huge fan i knew some of the songs 

i thought it was simple but at least for the most part it focused on her just doing what she was hired to do sing her songs 

i liked the floating platforms and the dancers around are were really good 

but i also dont like when theres so much else going on that the main act kind of gets lost in the shuffle when theres too much going on all at once sometimes the camera is one place and other things are going on in other places that way you dont really see the whole production
the problem i see is that youve only been with your bf a few months 
you admit yourself that you do not know him well enough or know enough about him that you need to know 
and this is why you never should have met his kids if you start to know the things you need to and do not like what you learn and leave those kids will be sad and confused 

but im also confused about something is he a single dad because he seems to have his kids every day with an hour to spare to see you 
where is the kids mom 
was this how it was when you first met
why cant you spend the evenings at his house and spend time with him after his kids go to sleep
why would you even ever entertain the thought of sleeping with someone elses boyfriend 

this is just plain wrong you are old enough to know that this is the cardinal rule nobody should have to tell you this 

stop hanging out with him alone and getting drunk no good will ever come from this 
he may sleep with you but hes going back to his gf
thats a bit harder to fix because its an issue for you but to him its not really an issue 

can you maybe schedule a few days a week i know it sounds so stupid to have to schedule your sex life but at least both of you are on the same page and sometimes it works just by the anticipation 
also keep in mind would you rather have sex for the sake of having it or would you rather have really good sex
sometimes quality over quantity 

also maybe dont put too much pressure on him start with 2 times a week and work up to 3 or however many works 

but you should start to figure out if you can be in this relationship more long term youve already spent 7 years and its not easy to leave when theres so much good but you dont want it to get to a point where your resentment takes over either
if its a matter of frequency then he doesnt see it as a problem because he thinks his sex drive is perfectly ok  and it is 

its just that yours and his do not match 

if its more a matter of what youre doing together you need to ask why he isnt willing to experiment some people just dont like some sex acts and really shouldnt be made to do them if it isnt their thing
you matched with her first but your bro was texting with her before you started dating 

how did that even happen 
you both must have been at the very least texting or talking with her at the same time and how did you find out bro was talking to her 

look if you dont see moving forward with her just let her go  why drag it out any longer
so does your ex usually pick your son up at 9pm so he can sleep at dads  

everything about this is just  off 

you pay your ex child support but you have him all day 

do yourself a favor and split custody with the ex 5050 no one pays child support and then youll have time for your bf
so dont give her access to all the money 

sit her down and show her your finances 

take the 4800 for the month minus all your household bills by now you have an idea what the variable ones avg out to  food etc 

take the net  thats left and left decide how much goes into emergency fund long term savings and depending on whats left decide on a weekly amount she can use for herself 

open separate accounts for the emergency savings and one for her money 

leaving is impulsive she doesnt work and you have two small kids your finances are not going to be better supporting a separate household for yourself and paying alimony  maybe and child support 

you say all hell breaks loose when you discuss money just tell her she can bitch and moan all she wants its still not going to change the fact that she is being irresponsible
where was your mom for those 2 hours
you should not have to sleep in the spare room unless you want to or your gf is so sickly contagious that its dangerous for you to be in your shared bed 

how long could it possibly take you to hang one load of laundry and in that time your gf went upstairs got ready for bed and also fell asleep 

oh and conveniently sometimes puts her glasses on your side of the bed so its a guess each night 

either she was not sleeping yet and purposely set you up to have a fight or she was sleeping and got unreasonably mad when you came to bed and woke her 

she really couldnt just wait for you to come up and you go to bed together 
thats pretty selfish in this instance considering she knew you were coming up pretty much right after her
the thing you need to remember is this 

when we start to date we have no idea what were doing were all fumbling around trying to figure out this whole bfgf thing so we date and we break up a lot mostly with no rhyme or reason 

who knows what your bf is thinking but dating you just isnt working for him anymore doesnt mean you did anything wrong 

stop being sad look at this as a learning lesson 
the lesson is enjoy it while it lasts take a day or two to mourn it and move on  but that doesnt mean on to yet another boy just for the sake of having a boy 

this too shall pass
most people realize that the 2 party system the us has is not working i think mainly because theres an us vs them mentality most elected officials dont think for themselves and just go along with party lines 
thats not to say they dont personally agree with some issues but it is unrealistic to think one person agrees with every single platform either party has 
and third party candidates have mostly been one off random candidates from one state here and there thats why the third party is looked at as a water vote 

that out of the way how does this sound
 a third party but with candidates in every state where an election is being held with a pretty centrist platform take the most popular stances of each issue and endorse that or whatever it is 

national elections take place every evennumbered year every four years the president vice president onethird of the senate and the entire house are up for election onyear elections on evennumbered years when there isnt a presidential election onethird of the senate and the whole house are included in the election offyear elections



so next year this third party could  have people running who could theoretically change  the whole look of all branches of govt 

im not gonna explain this correctly so bear with me 

how do we do this we let people in every state know that we have ppl running in all the diff states so me in state a can say i want to vote for party 3 and id like their agenda to be implemented i know one person from my state cant do anything alone but if a countrywide campaign can be implemented with a message of this party can get a majority of representatives  we can implement our platform 
it might make people rethink the wasted vote of a third party
could be that you just dont have an actual sexual attraction to that person her being good looking isnt really the only criteria 
maybe you need to have an emotional
attraction to a partner as well sex is sometimes as much emotional as physical 

and just wash your hands and clean under your fingernails
for me its not about trying to hold the family together 

its more the nephew is too angry for an 11 year old and i recognize that all is not well somewhere in his life it could be his mom has poisoned him against his dad and his fam it could be theres more to the story between his mom and dad that even the op doesnt know it could simply be that nephew is a troubled child   

but whatever the reason if he grows and gets to a place where he wants to make amends with his dads family he will have the knowledge that they always wanted him around and never actively excluded him 

thats just my take
if nephew wouldnt show up anyway you might as well extend the invite 

it keeps the peace with your brother and if nephew ever realizes that this side of the fam is decent you can always say that he was included and he never took you up on it 

but if you can schedule on moms weekend youd be better off 

as an aside
im still confused how his mom wanted nothing to do with the father of her childs family what did she want to happen shed raise the child alone and dad would just be ok with that  dad needs to get some some help so the boy can stop being so angry
nta

its your money that you earned 

its not as if you spend some of it youre putting an undue burden on your parents 

the fact is even with a full scholarship there are day to day expenses that you need money for 
coffee with friends a movie gasetc 

why dont you explain this to your mom and ask for a monthly amount dont divide all the money you have so its gone by the last month of school just try to figure out a nominal amount that you can get by with 

youll have some spending money and youll also still have some savings when you graduate unless something big comes up in the next few years
i found it odd too 

the woman tho i heard they have more info but not releasing it just yet something about who the man is that was seen running away 

the other guy it seems is a workplace issue the guy who killed him was an ex employee he was a gas or electric co employee so im not sure him being an elected official has anything to do with it 

now if the same guy killed both then we have a story
honestly he sounds a bit too controlling for my tastes but

we really dont know you nor what your individual needs are 

so if you say his what we see as controlling but you see as taking anxiety inducing decisions off of you then maybe its not as we see it 

have you tried to explain to your parents exactly how him making these decisions are actually helpful to you rather than harmful  im getting the impression they arent seeing what value they add to your well being 

this is also your first relationship so you dont really know how it should work do you you have nothing to compare him against the good and the bad 

as far as staying home after you marry it sounds lovely doesnt it until he starts complaining that youre hobbies are taking up too much of your free time and youre not dedicating enough time on his needs 
and framing it as you just arent using your time efficiently 
be on the look out for that please thats when you should reassess the whole him making decision ideas 


maybe you should work part time a few hours a few days a week just to retain some semblance of independence
maybe start with asking her to study or out for coffee 

you and she both should spend time together to see if you actually do like each other before you commit to something like the prom  idk any proms that are soon so im basing this off the us version of a prom
dont fall back into the its ok most days tho 
work it out now for everyones happiness yours theirs and your child 

you may open a pandoras box but wouldnt you rather know that now than years from now  yes you would
hey im on your side 

i just meant not to bring up the money part of it in a i paid for it way 
def ok to say why are you not done yet its been 7 yrs 

i would never hire someone to clean thats just a waste of money when someone is home all day with seemingly nothing else to do 

and absolutely do not being up being able to find another partner as tempting as that may be 
but i would say i didnt sign up to be and do everything in this relationship i need an equal partner and i have to know if youre willing to step up and be a partner or this isnt going to work for me

youve gotten some great ideas how to approach the things that need to be brought up 
please organize and use them and let us know how it goes
yeah no 

no way my partner would be waking up mid day thats just disrespectful on a whole other level id start waking them up when the rest of the household gets up in the morning 

your poor kid even recognizes that one parent is basically useless 
thats another point you can point out to your partner  i need to sleep to get up for work and kid has in the past refused to even ask you to do a late pickup knowing you will refuse its affecting them and we cannot have that going forward its not fair to our child 

i wouldnt harp too much on the accounting course but it needs to be mentioned that may come off as a money thing even if its not instead of a  it shouldnt take 7 years to finish a 2 yr program thing 

whoever cooks should be cleaning since they make the mess normally its the opposite but your partner seems unusually messy during cooking 

have that chat give yourself some time to organize what you want to say and how you want to say it 
you might as well just come out and ask if they dont want to be here anymore since this is the impression 
they are clearly giving 

send child out to a friends house i have a feeling this might not go so well
that article was condemned by pretty much everyone that read it 

since i dont know what can they do to clarkson can they make it so he can never write for a paper again
fine him charge him with a crime 

or will they just condemn it like everyone else
omg yes 
especially when its only a few months in 

if youre having this many or this big of a problem after a few months just get out 

why try to save a bad relationship
laid out like this obviously the division of labor is wildly unfair 

im curious tho how did it get like this 
you didnt just move in and you were doing the lions share was it a gradual tapering off of them doing less and less did partner start out as a sahp which if chores went undone it wasnt a big deal cause child care and rearing take a lot of time but then did they just get used to not doing much 
 this was me but any mention by my partner that things werent getting done caused some small level of guilt like i wasnt holding up my end of the bargain i wasnt being a good partner but thats just me

you need a serious sit down with your partner 
does partner have any health issues that may be contributing in any way 
do they have a hobby that theyre dedicating all their time to 

and in a very non accusatory  way you need to ask what the hell they do all day while you are at work 
kid is in school for most of the day i can see having to drop off and pick up but partner seems to basically do nothing 

make a list divide the work and specify specific days of the week things need to get done 
theres no reason laundry cant be done every other day for instance
its a nice thought but it really would not stop brandon from drinking 

the bigger problem is that brandon does not recognize that he is an alcoholic despite going thru rehab 

its normal to relapse but he seemingly has no plans to try to get back to sober 

and its not that you dont like the real him you actually do like real brandon its drunk brandon you dont like 

maybe your fianc should be having a come to jesus talk with brandon 

its fine if he decides that wants to be a jobless drunk but brandons friends should  be able to decide if they want to be friends with a jobless drunk regardless of how long the friendship has been
yta

im really curious why you adopted this child to begin with 

you already had one son when you adopted and went on to have another so its not a case of thinking you couldnt get pregnant and then miraculously did and she was no longer your only hope for a family  as some may think 

its pretty obvious she isnt treated as a d but as an adopted d 
she is your oldest child why didnt she get a car and pay for her school even if she got some scholarship you think she had to take loans so why didnt you just pick up the difference 

do you really think she does not know that shes the not wanted child shes a part of this family in name only 
i wonder if you did her any favors by adopting her she would have been better off with a family that wanted to give her an actual living family and parents
whats the rush  with this guy or any other

youre  in your early 20s with already one marriage that didnt make it  totally understandable and youre still not untangled financially from the first guy 

if you were with the first guy for 3 years and dating this guy for 1 year youre only 23 you got married at what 18 or 19
this guy might be the best guy ever but maybe you should just keep your separate space for a long while longer date him while being on your own for a while

so thats what you tell him  im not untangled yet and im not doing anything until that gets settled and im not jumping into living with anyone  until i know them inside and out and  been thru good and bad and very bad
but why if you were happy with her and wanted to make a life with her are you so compelled to talk to women online 

you must realize that makes you pretty sleazy 

thats why shes leaving you not because of some grand scam she was trying to pull 

she might have been happy to leave everyone and everything she has back home for a better life with you
but you didnt exactly treat her with enough respect to lay off the other women 
i dont really care that you never physically cheated just the fact that its been going on for the whole duration of your marriage is a testament to what kind of man you really are 
it just took her too long to find out 

this is all on you
i hate saying it but youre right

she should have never been alone 
the h knew she was having problems im sure his and her family knew even if they never dreamed in a million years she would do something like this  because who would even think it at least have someone with her just to take some of the stress of everyday life with 2 kids and a newborn 

its just so tragically sad
is it possible that hes starting to think that hes leaving his 70 yo mom alone and thats why hes pushing for her to go 
idk if he has siblings left behind that can look after mom if she needs it 

has he explained why he doesnt think your mom and sister cant be trusted to come with you 
thats an odd thing to say 

is he afraid your mom and sis wont contribute financially to the renting of the property because apparently his mom wont be and hes worried it will all fall to you guys 
so maybe instead of renting both homes as a unit you can each get separate rental agreements on your and their home so you and h wont be on the hook if they decide not to hold up their end  

idk just throwing out ideas
its not what they do or say its what they do or say in that moment

if they shut down someone being rude snarky or harassing the first time it happens that goes a long way to show people that you have confidence in yourself and arent going to take any crap from anyone
you know hes kind of down in the dumps lately i think it would be a really loving gesture for you to do something nice for him without expecting anything in return 

you can agree to watching a movie together but maybe you can make a surprise nice dinner for you two maybe his favorite just to cheer him up or a dish you make really really well pick up a candy heart and share it as you watch the movie buy a bag of those hearts with words on them and trade them back and forth 
basically make a cute romantic night in 

express to him how much you value him for him not for what he does for you 

his situation wont always be this way so support him as you would want him to support you if the roles were reversed
 nta
and congratulations  you should be so proud  

have you explained to your parents about the hs grad party and the sweet 16 

and why cant they just let you have this one thing that you are paying for on your own 

i would text all three of them and point these things out 
youre not asking for anything from any of them you just want to be celebrated once in your life for your accomplishments 

how they respond to the facts laid out in black and white should tell you all you need to know if they should be invited or not
well done india
lets look at the two people in this scenario in a 2 yr relationship that is not 100 solid 

you readily admit to mental health issues and what you are doing to help yourself get to a better place good for you in recognizing this should be your number 1 priority 

she on the other hand also has some mental health issues and is doing nothing to try to get to a better place 

now these mh issues have in some small way caused her to forget to take her pill thus contributing  not solely to the pregnancy it is totally possible that she could have taken the pill perfectly and still have a pregnancy but the chances are higher by her skipping pills 

do you really think that two 19 yos with mental health issues who cannot afford to support themselves are ready and able to care for and raise a baby  

that is the reasoning you needs to speak with his gf about the actual practicalities of raising this child not your immediate feelings not her immediate feelings the actual nitty gritty 

who is gonna work to support this little family you her both of you then who is gonna watch the baby if you two both work how are you going to afford daycare 
you both work now and still cant afford to move out of your parents house 

can either of you earn enough to support all 3 of you rent food utilities car payments doctors formula clothes etc 

it sounds so exciting to have a baby but the truth is its the hardest job in the world to raise a healthy happy well adjusted person because thats what you will be doing for the next 18 years 

and if you decide to have this baby please heed this  my very unscientific conclusion from fam and friends is that women are more fertile after having the first baby so lay off her  keep that in the back of your mind 

i have no opinion on what you and her should do i just think you both need a serious sit down to discuss the actual realities of having or not having this child
have you explained to him that long explanations get lost on you that you physically cannot keep your attention on a long monologue 
im not so sure that eye contact is needed sometimes i have to picture what the other person is saying in order to get it 

ask him to break it up and check that youre following him 

for ex first i unscrew this got it then i take this part off making sure i dont scratch it got it  and on and on 

youll have to be honest tho when you dont get it and he may have to repeat himself but hell have to be understanding about that
ah ok that clears up a lot 

i thought you lived with your bf family full time and that you havent been in touch with your dad for a while 

i am changing my judgement to yta just for asking bf to skip the wedding 

youre nta  for being upset that your bf didnt get a plus one id be upset at that for the fact that youre together a long time and additionally your bf is an adult and a plus one is usually how invites go for adults unless no other cousins were also  no plus ones 

im sorry if i came off as harsh wasnt my intention at all 

do you have any friends that you can spend that weekend with in your hometown that you can stay with 
you can avoid your dad and go visit your mom
yta  maybe 

im confused as to why it takes you days to deal with your moms anniversary day 
i say this in a not mean way but in a you need to get a handle on it for your own mentally stable peace of mind 

please dont come at me yes i know everyone is different and people grieve in their own way 
i understand losing your mom was awful being young but you are an adult now and you need to find a way to deal with your feelings around this day without it seemingly being a multi day grief session that is not healthy in any way 
i lost my father as a grade schooler and my mom 10 years back so i am familiar with your feelings 

his fam saying you can just stay in the hotel is leading me to think theyve been around for this date prior and my thought that this is indeed a multi day thing is correct they may have been thinking you being alone isnt the best thing for you 

your bf will be home on the day of moms passing so thats not an issue 
he can support you however you need 
travel day is probably the next day on friday so you wont be in a happy jolly mood but you should be able to handle traveling 

the wedding is on sat emotionally you should be able to go to the wedding even if youre not the most excited there its a happy occasion so celebrate along 

your dads bday is tuesday and you will be home by then but you dont even talk to him so i dont know why this day would even be on your radar 

as far as the plus one
that is a standard way of invited when being invited i dont know where you got the idea that you werent invited your bf is in the fam he gets a plus one hes bringing his gf 

there is a lot of emotional stuff surrounding these dates you need to talk to someone who can help you move past your grief and anger in regards to your family
chocolate 
that weird chocolate truffle thing
and when the father treats the white grand baby better than the step grand baby  his wife will be all  well its his blood grand baby 

this will not end well at all 

idk if her dad can change his views and mind but if hes not all in hes out
esh

i think amy is trying to stick it to her mom for making her wear dresses as a kid 

anyway obviously the dress code is different but its amys wedding 

but youre not going to change amys mind so do yourself a favor and just go with it its one day and unless you want to lose your d and her wife you are going to have to bite the bullet here 

your wife can wear a pantsuit that has very wide flowy pant legs that basically look like youre wearing a dress 
something like this



these would look lovely with a dressy blouse
yta

your having a baby this april and getting married next year 

really by next year you will be perfectly ok with not taking a 1 yo on your honeymoon 

now to his child how long have you been together that you havent bonded with this child im not saying you have to fall head over heels for her instantly but by the time you marry this guy you should have stronger feeling then shes a nice little girl  

marrying a guy with kids means you will be another parental figure in her life if you arent willing to do that then you are doing all of you a huge disservice he will or at least should put his d first and that means if you dont get on board youll be the one sending your child for fortnight visits 

i hate the thought that his first d will always be less to you 
dont be that stepmom be better do better 

neither of these children should be going on the vacation that youre calling a honeymoon
you realize waiting until you each get your fill of sex with other people over a few years is never going to happen 
i think you both have this romanticized idea in your heads that this is your person when clearly it is not 

you didnt like the sex with him but then had sex with 7 other guys  but only hooked up with 2 how does that work and hated all those experiences too now suddenly the sex with him is good could it be that you realize sex for the sake of having sex is not your thing and you actually need an emotional connection to a person not just an act 
whatever is going on with you two is not sex related 

so while you both will be out there meeting others one or most likely both of you will find someone else you will want to be with long term 

youll both mature change and find that the young love you have now is not the love that will sustain you for a lifetime 

if its just a matter of being with other people then pick a number that you think will satisfy this crazy idea and get it done now 

of course that has its own problems with jealousy what you did what he did and with who it will just cause more issues between you two and youll end up breaking up anyway 

just admit this relationship has run its course and move on 

if by chance you both happen to meet up in the future and it works out then great but this isnt something that you can or should plan your life around
i love those shows  i look at the ingredients and think  no way theyll be able to incorporate like candy corn and somehow they do 

maybe her partner should spend his time watching and getting some ideas
 nta

if hes such a great chef he can make great meals with whatever you buy 

like those cooking shows where they have to make something from random foods in a basket 

when he gets a job and contributes to the household he can buy and cook whatever he wants 

i dont understand why he cannot grasp this
youre talking about a celebrity who she is in all likelihood never ever ever going to meet its like being jealous of a ghost 

and there is nothing wrong with finding strangers attractive

look there was a time where i only had eyes for my partner would actively look around and try to find someone who caught my eye  not
to cheat just to see if there was one
and i couldnt find one 

did i think my partner never found anyone else attractive hell no  did i think there was anything wrong with me or them no i was secure enough in my partner to know i had nothing to worry about 

its all about trust work on yours 

it sort of seems that you might be a bit insecure but in a way that you think your partner is  i hate this expression out of your league 

shes with you she likes you enjoy it and as i said in my first post stop sweating the small stuff

if you booked with an agent then the cruise line will not be able to discuss your booking it has to go thru the agent 
so call them first to cancel this way depending on how far off the trip is you will get refunded all or a portion of the cruise fare but you will get refunded any port taxes and fees and any other pre paid add ons 

next would be the travel insurance idk who or what policy you have but usually any 3rd party travel ins kicks in after your primary 
so your travel ins may just tell you to submit all bills later on after you have outstanding bills from what your primary did not cover 


hope your wife will be okay
i was the last in the fam to get one and i only got my first one just because everyone else in my fam had one 

kept it because i cant even imagine trying to learn a new phone system 
i know thats a stupid reason  
i am very tech challenged  started with a 5 and my 8 is still doing just fine
nta

he never even realized you dont shave and he never thought you were unhygienic before 

so his argument doesnt make sense
that is the stupidest sentence i have ever read  

if youre uncomfortable when you dress for any occasion youre doing it wrong
generally community colleges will let you enroll regardless of gpa 
unless there is an unusually weird amount of students enrolling that semester 

make an appointment with an admissions counselor at your local and see what they say 
they have seen  and heard it all and wont judge you they are there to help you 

be prepared to take a bunch of remedial classes to bring you up to have the skills for 100 level college classes 
but thats fine i did a few when i was a returning student they helped me refresh all the stuff i forgot years ago

you can do this you just need to start 
best of luck to you
go to the financial aid office at your school explain everything to them and see if there are grants loans emergency aid that you can get 

see if you can be an ra in the dorms for this or next semester that way your room and maybe board will be covered 
you can still keep your job too
how is no one realizing that this teacher is taking 20  4th grade 9 yos to a water park and is what
letting them all go off on their own wherever 

water parks are dangerous no way any school ive ever had to deal with would allow that there would be parents going and assigned a group of kids to be responsible for 

as far as this situation i would have made sure my kid didnt have to babysit the boy no one likes and only if that wasnt done would i not let her go 
and i wouldnt have bought the vip tix for the same day id have done something else with my kid
he has an older brother who is married and has a child 
someone said it is his step bro idk about that tho 

i do remember seeing her posts tho and the bro also posted about a scholarship or something i dont remember exactly
if you were my d this is what i would tell you 

you have seen how he is for a whole year already  do you think he is going to suddenly wake up one day and be a considerate non yelling insulting bf

do you think if you just try harder to please him 247 then he wont ever get mad at you and call you insulting names  

i am telling you right now

that will never ever happen 

and that his not what being a partner is you dont change and compromise for anyone just so that wont get mad at you 

this is not love you dont love him he certainly does not love you 

get away from him now before he hurts you worse 

stop dating  im serious you are way too young that this is your second abusive bf 

you need to understand that you are worth way more than you have been getting having a bf is not the be all end all find a few good friends to spend your time with or hell be alone for a bit enjoy your own company find what makes you happy that isnt a boy 

see what good relationships look like and see what the crappy ones look like 
then when you know what behavior you expect from a guy you will be able to leave when the first bad behavior comes up
so i just looked up port charges for gc here i didnt even know this  info was available but i took a shot and googled



it cost 726 per person plus another 3675 for the ship 

so if we divide the 3675 by the number of passengers  idk what ship so lets say 3000 passengers that comes to 012 cents per person 

so 726 plus 02 thats 728 per person 

the 10 credit per person works as far as a refund for port fees 

ncl gave you a credit to your shipboard acct instead of a direct credit to your original form of payment
the only problem i see is in the future which most people dont think about 

hes going to get to a point where he slows down and you wont be able to do some things together 

think of the activities you do now with him as a 45 yo when you are 45 hell be closer to 60 hes not going to have the energy for it 

then dont discount his health you may find yourself being his carer and thats not an easy thing to do if youre in the midst of a career or are raising youngish kids or both at the same time 

i know 2 couples with at least a 15 year gap and the men are both facing health issues and their wives are of course doing what needs to be done but being a 50 something and scheduling your life around doctors and tests is not fun and neither has any kids 

just something to think about
she just started a new job and believe it or not its a difficult one 

not just physically but mentally and add to that the fact that im sure shes stressed to no end wondering if shes doing this job right 
all that combined is a recipe for exhaustion 

she needs time time to feel like shes on a good footing with the job time to build the confidence she needs to go into school every day knowing shes doing a good job time to learn all those shortcuts that veteran teachers know that cuts her at home work down 

what she needs is a supportive bf who is willing to deal with this transition period of her life because he wants to support her to succeed 

she doesnt need a needy bf who jumps to a dating app the second his gf doesnt give him the amount of attention he wants 

id love to see what happens next year when youre up to your eyeballs in textbooks and lack of sleep and she wants you to hang out 

are you going to put off studying to hang out 
i didnt think so 

frankly you dont deserve her youre too selfish
 yta

i am failing to see what is so wrong with him putting the ring in his mouth 

its really not a big deal

its a perfectly normal question to ask 

your friend is hiding something 
let me guess they met online and are long distance and he never actually met her
just passing on what i saw
the cd was in ops name effectively making it the legal property of op 

grandma verbally told op to give that one cd to nephew 

op emailed nephew nephew took a year to answer and then asked for gold 

op told nephew whyd it take you so long but ok ill send the check but the original cd was cashed and spent in expenses so the  is coming from me personally 

nephew responds give me my money it shouldnt take this long oh and send it to my dad 

ops lawyer advised since the cd was never in nephews name nor was the cd or nephew mentioned in grandmas will op legally doesnt  have to give nephew any money
i think i heard costa rica mentioned but idk where i got that from so its not very helpful 

and theres nothing on the costa rica reditt either so im starting to think there isnt another one
i saw a retired military somebody on fox  dont slam me they carried the shoot down live who said biden wanted to shoot it down on wed and the military talked him out of it 

this guy made a point of saying biden needs to have a little sit down with those guys and explain the chain of command 

so i think theres more to this whole incident than we know
yes i keep trying to find one news source about that balloon 

i cant find anything other than a blip that said us military was aware of one 
very strange
this is what youre unhappy about

 he doesnt tell you youre cute or pretty every day 
 he doesnt call you by your nickname
 he doesnt ask you how youre doing 
 he hasnt asked you on a date since fall
 he says hes not good at planning 


you have not once said what it is that you do for him that you should be appreciated for 

im sorry but you seem a bit insecure are you not confident in the fact that your bf likes your looks and wants to spend time with you 

that might be why youre going through rough patches you expect him to act and be a certain way without thinking that maybe thats just not him its easy to be so enamored in the beginning and then it tapers off 

thats not to say he should never give you compliments or plan something but you want him to do all the work why cant you plan a date
so see youre doing fine youre covering all scenarios and logically thinking things through 

just pay close attention over the next say 6 months if hes serious about you there is no reason you cannot start meeting his kids slowly at first and gradually to where you all can spend weekend time together thats a big tell to me about his intentions
ooh his wife asked for the divorce 
ill throw this out just cause i want you to think about things you wouldnt think of

some men just cannot be alone his wife ending things regardless of how he felt about you may have prematurely moved this relationship forward and im not saying he wants back with her im sure there were signs his marriage was in trouble 

im not saying this is true but roll that little nugget around a bit
ok so i think it may have been much easier for you coming out of a marriage that you and your ex had already realized was over to go all in with the new guy as opposed to him who im gonna guess sort of blindsided his wife with the divorce to an extent 


so hes dealing with guilt of hurting the ex guilt about the kids while also trying to move on with you its been a year so hes probably getting closer to the point of no guilt and ready to move on and maybe knowing this trip was always going to be coming up  which really was a stupid thing to do the parents havent been together for a year why make this trip why not just one of the parents take the kids why this charadehas hampered his moving on but the trip will be done he has no more reason to not wrap up his divorce and be all in 

also realize that his kids will always always cone first you will not have what you did in your marriage where its just the two of you and you can make plans on the fly and just go and be plans will be ruined if theres an issue with the kids and you have to be  ok with that 
its the kiss of death if a relationship if you cannot handle all that 

if after this trip he is not willing to have you meet the kids then id reassess his true intentions 

but for the next few days while hes gone do something for yourself to occupy your time it might be better if you two dont talk so much a check in is enough you dont want to get jealous and he doesnt want to temper what he says to you
and another excellent point to make 

this thread is so fascinating with all the ins and outs
something about this whole scenario just isnt sitting right with me 

info please 

hes separated yes  as in living apart but not with you from his soon to be ex wife seeing his kids whenever the custody is they agree on
oh and there was no cheating by either of you 


then i can weigh in better
id agree with that if  china had relayed that info before this balloon was spotted 

so they have a few weather balloon malfunctions possible if theyre trying something new and perfectly reasonable but just come out and say that before it enters into another countrys airspace 

if they want to be believed they have to be transparent about it 

even then we know the conspiracy theorists would be out in full force 

but until it comes down or gets forced down we wont know what it actually is and even then we might not ever be told the full extent of its capabilities
as i originally said i would have believed it was a weather balloon that went off course except that once it veered off and was clearly going to be entering close to or into another countrys airspace any country china should have said just that instead they said nothing 

now its possible they tried to play that story with either the us or canadian govt before it was spotted by whoever spotted it first but neither govt has said that was the case 

being that they didnt just leads me to believe that it wasnt just a wayward science balloon not to mention that theres another one and this one just traversed the country and is now over the carolinas where i believe we have large military bases  could be wrong 

theres no doubt that most govts dont trust china but them being transparent about it would have gone a very long way to minimize the evil china theories 

ill believe the us and canada before i believe anything china says and thats just based in history not just anti china anything

have you spoken to his bf and explained why hes not invited

brother might be feeling its a rejection of him his bf but bf might just see the rationale 

as long as you and bf have always gotten along and there is no animosity he should understand and help to calm your bros thinking
yta

are you freakin kidding 
your son has been bullied and when he finally defends himself  not start not instigate but defends himself you actually think its ok to punish him more 

you are the absolute worst 

give me a break about this one instance ruining his future no college gives a rats azz about one suspension that can very easily be explained away 

those parents want to press charges let them and counter sue for harassment 
line up every single instance that your son has been bullied by these two over the years and absolutely obliterate them in court 

be a better advocate for your son
hes needed you in his corner for years and you havent stepped up 
do it now  

im so disgusted by you and i dont even know you
 never heard that 

ok ill wait for a third to show up somewhere else too
i might believe the balloon somehow got blown way off course

if there wasnt another one over south america 

two just seems a little too much of a coincidence 

i guess it might be possible both balloons got caught up in the same winds or jet stream but eh
im not sure that your love language actually is physical touch 

im thinking that you are just starving for some type of physical touch being that from your description of family you havent ever had much much of it 

explain to your gf this and let her know its not necessarily sex that youre looking for its more non sexual physical touch and closeness 
so you can hold hands while sitting next to each other while watching tv you want to rub her arm or leg if youre just lounging around youd like a hug hello or goodbye make sure shes ok with this level of touch tho 

see if thats what youre really looking for it will satisfy you and take the pressure your gf is feeling off

her wanting to spend money you dont have is exactly why she is in debt 

you cleared yours probably by being diligent and prioritizing spending while she seems like shes a bit more carefree financially 

you two need to discuss finances in brutal detail and figure out if youre compatible on this topic 

as a couple you both should know whats going on with the finances and recognize that even though it may be an occasion sometimes its just not a good time to spend more 
she knows about all the expenses you told us about how can she expect to spend another 700 for 1 night
i said it before they want the rf to admit to 

an unconscious bias in the monarchy as well as a plan to eradicate it

they want then to admit they didnt do enough to stop bad press of tw
 even if her actions whatever they were were truthfully reported

 then they want an apology for the above two things and to admit that the stupid duo were right about everything they claim  even tho they havent laid out any concrete proof 

they wont get any of it because its all 
delusions of two disturbed people
did you pay with a credit card
sone cards have some level of insurance 

check that
i totally understand keeping separate but what happens when for instance you have a baby and one of you stay home 

id imagine it would feel a little weird not having your own acct of money 
i cant imagine the working spouse not being ok with the sahp having access to their acct but i was curious 

anybody experience that and what did you do
im sorry you are going thru this 

but nows the time to be mad not sad 
much easier to forget all about him when youre so mad at what he put you thru 

so turn your thinking around be grateful you only spent 3 years with him and you have the best thing to come out of your relationship your d 

it shows just how invested he was that hes going away with his friends instead of trying to get you and his d back  be mad about that 

he has an addiction but tries to blame it in you as if you drove him to the compulsion he has nope be pissed about that too 

he lied for years get mad about that 

you are going to have an amazing life and youre gonna do it all by yourself you dont need him
so i guess serious humanitarian content highlighting their save the world complex is out 

great one more thing they wont get right as they know nothing about romance or comedy
i dont understand who the victim is 

my point was trying to say that she has a preconceived notion of what this country is like and the only way he may get her to change that is to show her sounds reasonable to me 

she may go and hate it but at least she was there to make an informed decision by him cancelling the trip he may have in her mind validated what she has been thinking all this time she can then think to herself see he knows its awful thats why he gave up trying to get me to go 

i wouldnt say he has to cure her of anything more like getting her to be more open to exploring something out of her comfort zone its been over 10 years maybe just putting up with her for another month wouldnt have been the worst thing
a mid range mobile will do the same things as a high end one talk text and data 

what else would you use it for youre not really gonna be able to do schoolwork on it 

so go better on the laptop
 nah

i also think it depends on how often you are trying to get the guys together 
something every weekend thats not gonna happen no mom wants the dad out having fun every weekend while she gets child care duty 

something like a dart league is a weekly commitment most working people  not just dads are probably reluctant to commit to that  as its just another thing to add to the list of somewhere i have to be on that night every week 

instead of just trying to get the guys together invite the couples over with their kids to watch a game play a game or even just to hang out 

the guys only should be an occasional thing
he had the side with the outlet for the alarm clock since he got up first 

then we had to switch cause the baby cradle only fit on that side of the bed its been that way ever since
honestly you sound so desperate to find a partner and that desperation will become apparent to anyone you happen to meet thats not a good thing 

you need to figure out why you feel that the only way to be happy is with a partner 

there are always times in everyones life where they are single that in itself should not be as big a deal as you are making it out to be 

go out with friends join a club pick up a new hobby do something anything just for yourself something that you enjoy 

stop expecting someone else to make you happy 

youre so young enjoy this time of your life your person will come at the right time
he doesnt want to date you anymore thats the reason 

but youre gonna hang on waiting for him to come up with some kind of problem or issue he has with you or your relationship and think together you can fix it did you ever think he doesnt want to fix it whatever it is if there even is a thing 

or theres no fixable reason he outgrew the relationship hes bored youre not what he wants anymore he met another and wants to pursue her but wont cheat on you so he breaks up 

just move on stop trying to figure it out hes not worth any more aggravation youll make yourself crazy
agree totally 

why would she or anybody really fight for and want to be with someone who doesnt want to be with them 

ive always had that attitude which is why i get over heart break pretty easily  first im hurt and upset then i realize they dont want me so i just move on 

which is what op should be doing
yeah but theres something about seeing a foreign country with a native 
thats when and how you see all the great local things on offer 

its just sad she wont experience thatespecially with you her h
but you wont convince her if she never goes there 

best thing would have been to counter whatever she says to whoever with the good things she moans about it and even her aunt telling her about going there didnt convince her 

she needs to see it to believe it and you just shut that down 

but also shes pretty awful to disparage your home country so viciously when she hasnt ever been there
oh ok then itll be fine 

you dont have to do anything 
let it cool id wash it and youre good
dont touch it till it cools off 

if there was nothing in the pan what happened to the pan
have you told him you dont feel like you two are connecting since youve had the kids 

you need to sit him down and lay it all out 
tell him he has to decide what his priorities are is it you and the kids or his sailing 
if its his family then he needs to be present not just for the kids but for you as a woman and his wife 

explain he cannot possibly be giving his all to  his job his kids his wife and his hobby something gets pushed to the back burner and you feel like its you and that needs to change 

not a threat just a statement of fact youre not getting what you need from him and if youre not then why should he even be there
its only been a few months and you admit its not 100 so why are you still there 

this should be the honeymoon phase where everything is great 2 ppl finding out everything about the other sharing stories of their lives their families etc 

not constant back and forth push and pull 

please find someone closer to your age in the same stage of life as you thinking about and going thru the same things as you 
youll find it a much easier happier relationship
i didnt go away to uni but dont most people have a roommate or 2 or 3 
i would think you start there youre all in the same boat not knowing anyone so you pal around with the few you do know 

you can expand that into the others on your floor i heard keeping your door open the first week or so is a good way i guess the more extroverted ppl pop their head in to say hi idk 

then you join a club or a team or volunteer to do something and you meet others that way 

eventually you find the few that you really click with and they become your closer friends
you should have been leary of a guy who seeks you out and professes to have a crush when hes never even met you 

that screams scam to me 

you dont say how long youve been together but i would delay moving in
yes we all did 

but youve been with him for 2 years 
that alone should be enough to be able to say that you trust him if you do not then why on earth would you have moved in with him 

you have to decide if you trust him or not because he is not going to put up with your constant insecurity forever 

thats not how a relationship works you trust until they give you a reason not to and he hasnt so count your blessings stop looking for drama and have a stress free life with the guy who wants to be with you 

stop this you are way too old for this kind of stuff 

even if the bag is back in there do you really think his 11 yo son even wants them heres a clue no he doesnt
oh silly me  i totally discounted the happy part 

i hope op updates as each of your timelines comes to fruition
oh come on shes actually going to make you move out over a guy who she just met  
thats ridiculous  whats he gonna want next

she needs to tell b that he hasnt been around long enough to start dictating who or what she can do with her apt and her life 

have a chat with a shes acting irrational over a guy
i agree 

i cant imagine how hed act if there was a big problem
perfectly fine take a class as an elective on what may interest you and youll find it
you are someones perfect person you just havent met him yet 

do not settle for anyone who is not all in for you 

you will get over this one and move on to someone better
congratulations  you earned it  

what are you thinking of studying
you will do great

sm actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his own kids as if thats something to be proud of 

wow and your dad has nothing to say about that  hes the biggest ah of  them all 

sm would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom 

you need a little chat with dad about what she said

im not sure where she lives when shes not at yours so she can either remain there every day shes not spending time with her bf or she gives it up and moves in with her partner and pays her share of expenses 
its one thing to spend time with a so its another when shes there for days at a time 

theres no reason she should be freeloading off you three 

you need a roommate meeting and she either moves in or is only there when bf is there and if shes visiting she doesnt get to crank the ac eat whatever she wants or treat it like its her home not that she can hang around all day while hes at work
someone correct me if im wrong please and ill delete this 

i think the point is that piers got fired from what i think was a pretty big morning news show when he dared to say probably amongst other things that he didnt believe what m claims 

so the fact that he was in a sense markled  lost his livelihood and now hes back because he has an interview with the pm which is a big deal
a couple of things off the top of my head 

if you can wait until after labor day a lot more states schools are back in session which might cut down the number of kids 

idk how big the ship you mentioned is but i would avoid any mega ship if your wife doesnt like crowds id stay with somewhere around 3000 people or less there may be less gimmicky things like rock walls or go carts or whatever riyal has 

we just returned from a carnival cruise  out of miami and there were a bunch  of lgbt couples and groups i dont know if it was the ship  celebration very big or the port or that ccl has lgbt meet ups on all their ships which is attractive to the demographic but i didnt see or hear anything disparaging  i realize im one person so that doesnt mean much 

this might cone off the wrong way 
but i dont know how else to put it so please forgive if it offends its absolutely not my intention idk if royal had a dedicated meet up but it might help to meet people like you and your wife  see this part i didnt know how to phrase who you can be comfortable hanging out with and sort of have your own gang of friends who are accepting 

i know people hate carnival but ive been on them and ncl and really enjoy both lines carnival has really fun deck parties
id go back anyway i cant possibly have another accident right yup im going with that 
we have 3 more booked for later this year 

but yeah it seems they arent gonna bill me which works for me  saves me from dealing with the insurance company
seriously needing evac is my absolute worst fear 
being so badly hurt that  they want me off the ship is terrifying
yeah had to do the report also 

they even took pics of my sneakers which i sort of understand in a weird way 

i would like to think its so they can see if theres a pattern to where and how accidents happen idk
thats what i was thinking since it happened on the ship
sounds like me hurt on day 2 it def put a damper on the vacation
im sorry your dad went thru that 

its scary when youre away from home and dealing with medical issues
thats what i expected to happen its just really odd that they havent charged me yet 

i have allianz also so its good to know that it wont be a nightmare if i do have to claim
oh yeah i def misunderstood your comment 
sorry 
ill just wait and see what happens
that is my worst fear and the reason for the outside travel insurance 

it covers the usual trip cxl and delay lost baggage etc but i got it mainly for medical and evacuation
i tripped and fell on stairs and broke my ankle so really not their fault not my fault just a misstep  i wasnt tipsy and was wearing sneakers it was just a freak thing 

they did tell me upfront that they dont take insurance which i knew and what all the charges would be for the doc and xrays after that i didnt really care what the charge was for  the cast just do what needs to be done 

i did have to speak to security for an accident report maybe that has some bearing also idk 

i figured theyd put it on my ship acct because they didnt ask for my cc 


i guess ill just keep waiting to see if maybe they direct charge my cc at some point its been 6 days since i went to medical but only 2 days since debark
thanks yeah my bill will def be higher than that so it cant be a threshold thing 
i was expecting a charge to show up on my acct but it never did weird
 nailed it in one  
perfect
im a bit confused 

what exactly is he doing that is making you feel bad 

the only clue i got was you feel uncomfortable and  or unwanted by him is this a result of the pregnancy is it a weight issue or what
no way in hell would i ever see any doctor that sil has seen or is her babies primary doctor that will only give her more ammunition 

you have no idea if what shes telling you is really what her dr had said 
her baby is small she has to find something to brag about 

both these babies are under a year old do i believe her baby is some super specimen of muscles idk i guess its possible will he continue on that same path who knows 

dont engage her at all if she makes any kind of off comment ask her straight up what shes trying to say put her on the spot
